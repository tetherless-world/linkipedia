We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of\n          observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and\n          resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic\n          regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but\n          that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological\n          responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems.\n      ", "attributeName": "w_Cl", "entityDescription": "water solute chemical concentrations over time", "attributeDefinition": "shallow riparian groundwater Chloride", "entityName": "335_water_solute_timeseries_1.csv", "unit": "milligramsPerLiter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "156", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002601", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Count", "entity": "ecso:organism", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "doi:10.5063/AA/hstuar01.6.3"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Plant biomass and animal species abundance were measured after disturbance of eelgrass (Zostera marina) at two sites at Drum Shoals (34 deg 42\u201940\u201dN, 76 deg 46\u201920\u201dW) in Bogue Sound and two sites at Middle Marsh (34 deg 41\u201932\u201dN,76 deg 37'20\"W) in Back Sound.  Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter).

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes litter bag study data on the decomposition of mud-flat species (1985-1987), as part of the decomposition section of MERP.\n\tThe high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). \n\tThe MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies. From 1985-1987, a short-term decomposition study was conducted to monitor the decomposition of the three dominant mudflat species (Aster brachyactis, Chenopodium rubrum and Sonchus arvensis) and two emergent macrophytes (Scolochloa festucacea and Scirpus lacustris) occurring on the drawdown surfaces of the experimental marshes (Nelson and Davis, 1986). \n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences: \nDavis, C.B. and van der Valk. 1978.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression.

The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896.

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest.

We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length).

The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.\n\nPublications:\nHoover-Miller, A., C.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 145", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "17", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002564", "characteristic": "ecso:chlorophyll_fluorescence", "entity": "envo:sea_water", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "df35b.28.9"}, "eml": {"abstract": "This project is a component of the integrated Long-term Monitoring of Marine Conditions and Injured Resources and Services submitted by McCammon et. al. The ocean undergoes year-to-year variability in the physical environment, superimposed on longerterm cycles, and potential long-term trends. These variations influence ocean chemistry, and propagate through the lower trophic levels, ultimately influencing fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Over the past 50 years the Northern Pacific appears to have undergone at least one clear regime shift, while the last 12 years have seen multi-years shifts of major atmospheric indices, leaving uncertainty about what regime the coastal Gulf of Alaska is currently in. Regime shifts are often expressed as fundamental shifts in ecosystem structure and function, such as the 1976 regime shift that resulted in a change from a shrimp dominated fisheries to one dominated by pollock, salmon and halibut. Long-term observations are also critical to describe the current state, and natural variability inherent in an ecosystem at risk of significant anthropogenic impact. Given the potential for such profound impacts, this dataset continues a multidisciplinary observation program which began in 1997 along the Seward Line and in PWS and will continue to assess the current state of the Northern Gulf of Alaska, during 2012-2017. Such observations form critical indices of ecosystems status that help us understand some key aspects of the stability or change in upper ecosystems components for both the short and longerterm.

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes belowground macrophyte production data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\tIn order to estimate net annual belowground macrophyte production, core samples of the belowground biomass were harvested in the late spring and in the fall. Shoot initiation early in the growing season depletes most of the belowground standing crop, and therefore spring sampling was done quickly (within 2 weeks) to capture this state. Underground biomass then reaches its seasonal maxima in the fall and was captured with the fall sampling. The resulting differences between the fall and spring standing crop biomass provided an estimate of net belowground macrophyte production (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Specifically we will estimate the number of whales foraging in winter, determine when and if there is a prey switch to herring, and how long whales focus on herring as prey. Year one was funded, small in scale with an intense monitoring strategy; year 2 would expand the scale up in area significantly. Year 3 will verify the impact on herring of the high numbers of humpback whales we observed in PWS during year 2. These data will be combined in a bioenergetic model to determine numbers of herring consumed (and energy content consumed). Lastly, the estimated numbers of herring consumed would be included in an age-structured model so that the significance of whale predation on herring recovery can be evaluated. Year 4 (2010) will close out the project with the completion of analysis, reports, and manuscripts.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 122", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "10", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002421", "characteristic": "ecso:dynamic_height", "entity": "envo:sea_water", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "df35b.21.6"}, "eml": {"abstract": "This program continues a 40(+) year time series of temperature and salinity measurements at hydrographic station GAK 1.

Since most of N (Greater than 90%) and P (around 90%) is in the organic form in the oligotrophic subtropical Florida Coastal Estuaries (FCES), study of the source and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ecosystem is crucial for the better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.  FCES are composed of estuaries with distinct regions with different biogeochemical processes.  Florida Bay (FB) is a wedge-shaped shallow oligotrophic estuary which lays south of the Everglades, the bottom of which is covered with a dense biomass of seagrass.  Whitewater bay (WWB) is a semi-enclosed mangrove estuary with a relatively long residence time, which receives overland freshwater input from the Everglades marshes.  Ten thousand Islands (TTI) covers the southwest margin of the Florida Coastal Everglades, which are highly compartmentalized by local geomorphology.  The sources of both freshwater and nutrients in FCES are difficult to quantify, owing to the non-point source nature of runoff from the Everglades and the dendritic cross channels in the mangroves.  Furthermore, the combination of multiple DOM sources (freshwater marsh vegetation, mangroves, phytoplankton, seagrass, etc.), and the potential seasonal variability of their relative contribution, along with the history of (photo)chemical and microbial diagenetic processing, and complex advective circulation, makes the study of DOM dynamics in FCES particularly difficult using standard schemes of estuarine ecology.  Quantitative information of DOM is very useful to investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DOM to a certain degree, however, qualitative information is necessary to better understand the source and dynamics of DOM.

The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896.

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Biomass by species and carbon and nitrogen pools of plants and soils were measured in 2002. Height and survivorship of spruce seedlings were measured in 1992, 1995, and 2002. White spruce  grew more rapidly in the presence of alder during the first six years.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C.

I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals.

Correlations between methane flux and water table position were significant at all sites for one annual cycle when water table fluctuations ranged from 15 cm above to 50 cm below the peat surface. Correlations were not significant during the second and third annual periods with smaller water table fluctuations. Methane flux was strongly correlated with peat temperatures at -5 to -40 cm (rs = 0.82 to 0.98) for all three years at sites with flora acting as conduits for methane transport. At shrub sites, the correlations between methane flux and peat temperature were weak to not significant during the first two years, but were strong in the third year. Low rates of methane consumption (-0.2 to -1.5 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) were observed at shrub sites when the water table was below -20 cm, while sites with plants capable of methane transport always had positive net fluxes of methane. The methane oxidizing potential at both types of sites was confirmed by peat core experiments.

Both the water balance and water residence times were calculated on monthly from 2001 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2011.

Due to high nutrient concentration in the termitarea vegetation, these plants are highly palatable and thus are more heavily utilized by herbivores.  High herbivory on the mounds reduces plant biomass, meaning these plants are less susceptible to fire.  This study proposes that trees on and off termite mounds exhibit different life history strategies (LHS) based on these factors.  LHS can be inferred from measuring certain characteristics, such as plant functional traits (PFTs):  plant height, number of stems, bark thickness, spinescense, and branch ramification.  There are no significant differences in functional traits on and off mounds except for the number of stems and average number of spines, but this seems to be species dependent.  Dichrostachys cinerea had on average more stems on the mound than off the mound (6.4+/- 1.049 and 3.297+/- 0.440 respectively) and Acacia exuvialis had more spines (12.982 +/-.423).

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 159", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "30", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002723", "characteristic": "ecso:boolean", "entity": "ecso:otolith", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "doi:10.5063/F19G5JRF"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Data collected during the course of fiscal year 2005-08 field activities include: herring age, sex, and size statistics, otolith micro-chemistry, and heart tissue fatty acid profiles from mature herring aged 3 to 15.

In this study, the influence of ripeness and size of the fig as well as location and human influence on the figs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 habitat were examined as possible determinants of wasp diversity in figs. After surveying 13 crops of F. sycomorus inflorescence, a total of 12 morphospecies were identified.  We found that ripeness, location, and human disturbance are the key characteristics for species diversity.  Fruit diameter did not show any relation with wasp diversity or abundance. Ripeness, at a micro scale, is an effective tool for selecting figs with high wasp morphospecies diversity.  We found that F. sycomorus occurring in riparian areas and non-human impacted areas have higher species diversity.", "attributeName": "long shrimp tan", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "The number of wasps present in each fig according to the morphospecies listed in row 1 (red writing indicates parasitoid wasp)", "entityName": "Figspeciecount.txt", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "37", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002210", "characteristic": "pato:frequency", "entity": "taxa:Hordeum_brachyantherum", "ent_no": "3", "pkg_id": "Collinge.3.34"}, "eml": {"abstract": "We studied ecological dynamics of vernal pool plant\n        communities in California, USA, focusing on: 1) effects of\n        dispersal limitation, order of colonization, and frequency of\n        colonization on plant community composition; 2) invasion of\n        vernal pools by non-native species, and 3) comparison of\n        restored vernal pools to naturally-occurring pools.

The variation of abiotic and biotic factors along the catena are well researched; however, the effects of these factors on community composition and diversity remain unstudied.  The aim of the project therefore was to assess the bottom-up controls of the differences in herpetofaunal communities along the catena.  The species within these communities were divided up into functional guilds and life history groups to further explain the presence of species at certain positions along the catena.  To sample herpetofaunal diversity, trap arrays were set up at the crest and valley bottom in four marula-knobthorn sites in the Skukuza landscape type, Kruger National Park, South Africa.  In addition, active searching was done to further sample the presence of herpetofauna at each site.  Soil characteristics and ground cover measures were collected at each site.  Data from this study (November 2009) was pooled with data from biodiversity surveys carried out in January 2009.  A total of 366 frogs frogs across 14 species and 43 reptiles across 12 species were captured in either the pitfall traps or identified during active searching.  There was no difference in species richness, abundance, or Shannon-Weiner diversity indices between the crest and valley bottom, however a difference was found in community assemblages.  It was found that soil type and depth influenced the presence of certain species along the catena.  Of all the environmental factors used to describe amphibian community assemblages, tadpole requirements for growth and development tended to be the strongest driver of species distribution.

The hydroperiod (duration and depth of inundation) at the freshwater sites influences floc organic matter preservation, where the floc at the short-hydroperiod site is more oxidised likely due to periodic dry-down conditions. Seasonal differences in floc composition were not consistent and the few that were observed are likely linked to the primary productivity of the dominant biomass (periphyton in the freshwater marshes and mangroves in the estuarine zone).

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

The operating variables were a current density of 0~240 A/m2, a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8~16 min, and a coagulant (anionic polyacrylamide) dosage of 0~22 mg/L. Water quality indicators investigated were electrical conductivity, suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and true color.

Under the operating conditions without coagulant addition, the highest removals for conductivity, SS, COD, and true color were 39.8%, 85.7%, 70.5%, and 97.1%, respectively (with an HRT of 16 min). The use of a coagulant enhanced the removal of both conductivity and COD. With an optimal dosage of 20 mg/L and a shortened HRT of 10 min, the highest removals achieved for the four water quality indicators were 37.7%, 88.7%, 74.2%, and 91.7%, respectively.

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest.

Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.\n\nPublications:\nHoover-Miller, A., C.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 102", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "19", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002579", "characteristic": "pato:concentration_of", "entity": "ecso:nitrate_nitrite", "ent_no": "3", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-sbc/1002/6"}, "eml": {"abstract": "\n      ", "attributeName": "NO2+NO3 [umol/l]", "entityDescription": "Profiles of dissolved and particulate constituents from bottle samples, plus corresponding CTD data from the Seabird \"btl file\".", "attributeDefinition": "concentration of the sum of nitrate and nitrite", "entityName": "LTER02_CTD_bottledata.txt", "unit": "micromolePerLiter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "5", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002885", "characteristic": "ecso:saturation", "entity": "ecso:oxygen", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-pie/113/5"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Continuous measurements, every 15 minutes, were made of stage, water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH in Cart Creek, Newbury, MA, a small headwater stream draining a mainly forested catchment (55% forest + 19% wetland).

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 115", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "33", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002719", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Count", "entity": "ecso:sample", "ent_no": "2", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-gce/559/4"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Conductivity, temperature and pressure were measured continuously at Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER sampling location GCE8_Hydro (Altamaha River near Aligator Creek, Georgia) from 01-Jan-2014 through 31-Dec-2014.

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Biomass by species and carbon and nitrogen pools of plants and soils were measured in 2002. Height and survivorship of spruce seedlings were measured in 1992, 1995, and 2002.

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al. (1995).

(1996). \n\nAbstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.", "attributeName": "calcium", "entityDescription": "Lake nutrient and physical parameter data from 1990 to 1996.

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Biomass by species and carbon and nitrogen pools of plants and soils were measured in 2002. Height and survivorship of spruce seedlings were measured in 1992, 1995, and 2002. White spruce  grew more rapidly in the presence of alder during the first six years.

Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of\n          observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and\n          resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic\n          regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but\n          that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological\n          responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems.\n      ", "attributeName": "s_TN", "entityDescription": "soil solute chemical concentrations over time", "attributeDefinition": "surface soil extractable total N in mg per kg dry\n            soil", "entityName": "335_soil_solute_timeseries_1.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "6", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002941", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Name", "entity": "ecso:treatment_protocol", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-pie/120/8"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Aboveground biomass is determined non-destructively at permanent plots in a Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh in North Inlet, Georgetown, SC.

Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.\n\nPublications:\nHoover-Miller, A., C.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.\n\nPublications:\nHoover-Miller, A., C.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Therefore, it is hypothesised that the advantage of long limbs (i.e. increased efficiency of movement) may decrease in smaller organisms, where it is important that interstitial habitats can be effectively exploited using relatively shorter limbs. Positive allometric relationships between limb length and body size have been previously found in several ant taxa. We tested a corollary of the SGH by examining limbs in three taxa which were all capable of flight, hypothesizing that organisms in planar environments would have relatively longer limbs (either wings or legs) than organisms that utilise rugose environments. The lengths of bird and bat wings from differing habitats were obtained from the literature, and measurements of limb length, leg length, and pronotum width were taken from dung beetles caught in two different habitat types, one rugose, the other planar, in Skukuza, Kruger National Park. The strongest support for the SGH came from the bird taxa, where birds in a rugose environment (i.e. forest) had relatively shorter wings than birds from three planar environments (grassland, open coast and marine). Although there were signals of emerging support for SGH in bats, there were no significant trends present. It was proposed that this arose due to the use of forearm length as a proxy for wing size, and failed to capture total bat wing length and variability. Dung beetles also showed relatively little support for the SGH. Since dung beetles utilise two forms of locomotion, the trade-offs constraining their morphology are more complex than those that can be explained by the SGH.", "attributeName": "Mesocoxal", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "Length of mesocoxal", "entityName": "Sizegrain_beetles_data.txt", "unit": "millimeter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "40", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002640", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Name", "entity": "ecso:treatment", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "doi:10.5063/AA/nceas.347.3"}, "eml": {"abstract": "The cycles of the key nutrient elements nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) have been massively altered by anthropogenic activities.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2).

We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

We analysed floc samples collected from different environments in the Florida Everglades and applied biomarkers and pigment chemotaxonomy to identify spatial and seasonal differences in organic matter sources.

Freshwater floc receives organic matter inputs from local periphyton mats, as indicated by microbial biomarkers and chlorophyll-a estimates. At the estuarine sites, the floc is dominated by mangrove as well as diatom inputs from the marine end-member. The hydroperiod (duration and depth of inundation) at the freshwater sites influences floc organic matter preservation, where the floc at the short-hydroperiod site is more oxidised likely due to periodic dry-down conditions. Seasonal differences in floc composition were not consistent and the few that were observed are likely linked to the primary productivity of the dominant biomass (periphyton in the freshwater marshes and mangroves in the estuarine zone).

However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.\n\nWalker, C.M., D.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes a litter bag study on root decomposition, collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP.\n\tThe high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). \n\tThe MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies.The objective of this short-term decomposition study was to examine the belowground decomposition and nutrient dynamics of the root and rhizome litters of the dominant emergent macrophytes present in the Delta Marsh, Manitoba (Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1997; Nelson, 1988).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences: \nDavis, C.B. and van der Valk. 1978.

However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.\n\nWalker, C.M., D.

Therefore, it is hypothesised that the advantage of long limbs (i.e. increased efficiency of movement) may decrease in smaller organisms, where it is important that interstitial habitats can be effectively exploited using relatively shorter limbs. Positive allometric relationships between limb length and body size have been previously found in several ant taxa. We tested a corollary of the SGH by examining limbs in three taxa which were all capable of flight, hypothesizing that organisms in planar environments would have relatively longer limbs (either wings or legs) than organisms that utilise rugose environments. The lengths of bird and bat wings from differing habitats were obtained from the literature, and measurements of limb length, leg length, and pronotum width were taken from dung beetles caught in two different habitat types, one rugose, the other planar, in Skukuza, Kruger National Park. The strongest support for the SGH came from the bird taxa, where birds in a rugose environment (i.e. forest) had relatively shorter wings than birds from three planar environments (grassland, open coast and marine). Although there were signals of emerging support for SGH in bats, there were no significant trends present. It was proposed that this arose due to the use of forearm length as a proxy for wing size, and failed to capture total bat wing length and variability. Dung beetles also showed relatively little support for the SGH. Since dung beetles utilise two forms of locomotion, the trade-offs constraining their morphology are more complex than those that can be explained by the SGH.", "attributeName": "Tibia", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "Length of tibia", "entityName": "Sizegrain_beetles_data.txt", "unit": "millimeter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "8", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002067", "characteristic": "pato:conductivity", "entity": "envo:water", "ent_no": "5", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-cap/396/6"}, "eml": {"abstract": "\n                Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem ecologists study the same phenomena\n          (e.g., nutrient cycling, energy flow, succession) but they do so within separate\n          conceptual frameworks. Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods.

These enriched waters may enter into Kachemak Bay, the inflow tending to stay along the southern shore flowing past the Seldovia instruments, while water flowing out of the bay stays along the Inner Bay and north shore, flowing past the Homer instruments.

The ocean undergoes year-to-year variability in the physical environment, superimposed on longerterm cycles, and potential long-term trends. These variations influence ocean chemistry, and propagate through the lower trophic levels, ultimately influencing fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Over the past 50 years the Northern Pacific appears to have undergone at least one clear regime shift, while the last 12 years have seen multi-years shifts of major atmospheric indices, leaving uncertainty about what regime the coastal Gulf of Alaska is currently in. Regime shifts are often expressed as fundamental shifts in ecosystem structure and function, such as the 1976 regime shift that resulted in a change from a shrimp dominated fisheries to one dominated by pollock, salmon and halibut. Long-term observations are also critical to describe the current state, and natural variability inherent in an ecosystem at risk of significant anthropogenic impact. Given the potential for such profound impacts, this dataset continues a multidisciplinary observation program which began in 1997 along the Seward Line and in PWS and will continue to assess the current state of the Northern Gulf of Alaska, during 2012-2017. Such observations form critical indices of ecosystems status that help us understand some key aspects of the stability or change in upper ecosystems components for both the short and longerterm.

The primary goal of this monitoring, according to the technical appendix to the Long-Term Water Agreement (Green Book) are to detect any \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant decreases and changes in Owens Valley vegetation from conditions documented in 1984 to 1987\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Vegetation live cover and species composition documented during the 1984-87 mapping effort were adopted as the baseline for comparison with each annual reinventory according to the Agreement.  The reference measurements collected within individual areas mapped with similar vegetation (parcels) are referred to as baseline.\n\nThe Green Book details certain decreases and changes in vegetation community types that must be avoided under the Agreement.  Baseline vegetation communities in which evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation were classified as groundwater-dependent communities and are referred to as Types B, C, and D.  These phreatophytic communities are dependent on shallow groundwater to maintain plant populations, as precipitation alone is inadequate to meet the water demand of evaporation and transpiration (Sorensen et al. 1991, Steinwand et al. 2006).  For these parcels, according to the Green Book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe goal is to manage groundwater pumping and surface water management practices so as to avoid causing significant decreases in live vegetation cover\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to prevent a significant amount of vegetation from changing to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvegetation type that precedes it alphabetically (for example, Type D changing to either C, B, or A vegetation).\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The goal is to manage the effect of pumping on the depth to groundwater to maintain baseline plant communities.\n\nTo determine whether significant decreases and/or changes in vegetation have occurred, three criteria need to be met that are described in the Green Book: (1) measurability of vegetation change, (2) attributability of vegetation change to LADWP groundwater pumping or surface water management and (3) degree of significance defined by the magnitude, extent, duration and permanency of the change along with other factors including air quality, human health, impact to species of concern, etc. To avoid confusion, it is noteworthy to highlight that the standard dictionary definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeasurability\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the degree to which something can be measured.  Vegetation of course can be measured and thus the first criteria for determining significant decreases or changes in vegetation may seem to the reader unfamiliar with the Green Book, unnecessary.  However, the Green Book assigns a different definition to the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeasurability\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094defined in part as a change that is statistically significant.  Thus the first criteria, measurability, can be used interchangeably with statistical significance in the context of the technical appendix (Green Book) to the Agreement.  A main objective of the vegetation annual report is to evaluate the statistical significance (measurability) of vegetation change compared to baseline.  The second criterion, evaluating whether a statistically significant change in vegetation is caused by water management (attributability), is beyond the scope of this report owing to the need for a comprehensive analysis on a case by case basis for each vegetation parcel.  Another source of confusion may arise with the third criterion which is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdegree or significance\u00e2\u0080\u009d of environmental change.  For this criterion to be met, statistical significance is necessary but not sufficient.  As described above, there are several other factors in addition to statistical significance that must be demonstrated to evaluate the degree of significance for the third criterion.  For an example of a comprehensive evaluation of all three criteria for an individual parcel, see the report \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnalysis of Conditions in Vegetation Parcel Blackrock 94\u00e2\u0080\u009d (available at www.inyowater.org).\n\nA large proportion of groundwater-dependent parcels were mapped during baseline as Type C alkali meadows (61%), and the Agreement seeks to prevent these meadows from changing to shrub-dominated communities (Type B), a state change that is associated with increased depth to groundwater.  Alkali meadows are of special concern because small increases in depth to groundwater can decouple the groundwater from the root zone of grass species (Naumberg et al. 1996, Elmore et al. 2006).  Alkali meadow comprises 0.1% of the vegetation community types in California and 80% of alkali meadow communities are located within the Owens Valley (Davis et al. 1998).  Local management of this community type will determine the likelihood these ecosystems persist in a changing environment.  \n\nVegetation change across the Owens Valley was evaluated at both the valley scale and for each of 111 individual parcels sampled in 2013.  First, at the valley-wide scale we evaluated plant community cover and composition in parcels affected by groundwater pumping and for parcels that were relatively unaffected by groundwater pumping during the period of maximum pumping rate (1987-1993).  Second, we assessed whether transpiring vegetative cover differed over time for locations influenced by pumping compared to locations not influenced by groundwater pumping.  Third, we quantitatively assessed the divergence of these groups of parcels from the baseline cover values recorded from 1984 to 1987.  Fourth, we assessed whether vegetation composition in wellfield or control groups had changed from baseline values.  Lastly, since determination of significant impacts attributed to water management by LADWP is made on a case by case basis at the individual parcel scale, we (a) quantified the magnitude of change in perennial vegetation cover over the twenty-three year reinventory period, (b) assessed whether the relative proportion of woody vegetation (hereafter shrub), gramminoid vegetation (hereafter grass) and non-gramminoid herbaceous vegetation (hereafter herb) has changed compared to baseline and (c), quantified the temporal trends of vegetation composition for each parcel and evaluated what environmental factors explained the observed patterns in vegetation change.", "attributeName": "Herb", "entityDescription": "Line point transect data 1985-2013", "attributeDefinition": "# herbaceous hits out of 100 possible", "entityName": "Transects.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "7", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002327", "characteristic": "pato:concentration_of", "entity": "ecso:ammonium", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-fce/1069/5"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Porewater samples are collected at SRS1b,SRS2,SRS3, TS/Ph-1-5 within the 1 m^ aboveground sawgrass nondestructive biomass plots.

To achieve this goal, major and minor\n\t\t\t\tions were measured in both northern and southern Wisconsin streams located in a variety of\n\t\t\t\tland use settings.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it.

The strength of these effects can be regulated in part by predator abundance and nutrient availability.

Although our original purpose was to understand the structure of salt marsh arthropod food webs, BP's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf Coast presented an opportunity to understand how stress from an oil spill might affect the variables that we were measuring. The fact that we had plots and transect sampling in place at multiple sites along the Gulf and East Coasts put us in a position to evaluate any impacts that might occur if oil hit some of the sites. The study was conducted at 11 sites across the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida, and 11 sites along the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Maine. At each site, experimental plots were sampled and a 100m transect was sampled near the plots within 5m of the high marsh boundary. Sampling was conducted in May 2009, August 2009, and August 2010. In 2010, four extra sites were added to the existing experimental sites because of known oil contamination, and another site was added as an extra control.

However, arthropods are essential to the normal functioning of savanna ecosystems, and thus it is important to determine these factors. Because environmental factors associated with tree size may drive patterns of insect diversity and because park managers are actively investigating the impact of elephant damage on large tree populations, we aimed to assess the differences in arthropod communities beneath large and small trees with respect to several environmental characteristics including canopy cover, soil penetration, leaf litter mass, number of surrounding trees, and tree diameter, height, and canopy reach. Organisms were sampled using pitfall traps. We found that while arthropod species richness is not different between small and large trees, average arthropod abundance is greater beneath large trees. Specifically, we found that (1) diptera and coleoptera abundance is greater under large trees, (2) orthoptera abundance is greater under small trees, and (3) there is no difference in hymenoptera abundances. In a Spearman rank analysis, we found that though few correlations exist between insect abundances and the environmental factors measured, diptera abundance increases with tree diameter, height and canopy reach. The observed differences in arthropod abundance between small and large trees suggest that a mixture of trees of different sizes throughout these ecosystems contributes to heterogeneity of insect diversity in the landscape.", "attributeName": "Tree sp", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "The species of the tree under which we sampled.", "entityName": "Arthropod_treesp.txt", "unit": ""}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "5", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002945", "characteristic": "pato:elevation", "entity": "ecso:marsh_surface", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-pie/35/8"}, "eml": {"abstract": "A Surface Elevation Table (SET) is used to measure changes in the elevation of the marsh surface at three long term marsh fertilization experimental research sites.

Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al.

(1996). \n\nAbstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.", "attributeName": "zoo_count", "entityDescription": "Zooplankton counts from sampling at Red, Upper Station and Akalura lakes, with varying dates.

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Biomass by species and carbon and nitrogen pools of plants and soils were measured in 2002. Height and survivorship of spruce seedlings were measured in 1992, 1995, and 2002.

This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods.

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

How to increase the taxol yield in Taxus cell cultures has been viewed to be a great economical potential. Since taxol yield is low in plants and cell cultures, the greater amounts of two taxoids: 10-deactyl baccatin III (DB) and bacctin III (BC) were then used to be precursors that were synthesized to form taxol. To increase the taxoid yield in cell cultures, a good cell line and methyl jasnomate (MJ) treatment were proven to be effective in many studies. In our study, MJ is not only to increase taxoid yield, but also increase the kinds of taxoids. We presumed that MJ might be a good indicator to select important genes among the tens genes in taxol biosynthesis. We selected and cloned genes of taxadiene synthase (TS) and 10-deacetyl baccatin III-10-O-acetyl transferase (DBAT). TS is the first gene of taxol biosynthesis pathway, while DBAT gene controls the reaction of DB to become BC.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression.

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes litter bag study data on the decomposition of mud-flat species (1985-1987), as part of the decomposition section of MERP.\n\tThe high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). \n\tThe MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies. From 1985-1987, a short-term decomposition study was conducted to monitor the decomposition of the three dominant mudflat species (Aster brachyactis, Chenopodium rubrum and Sonchus arvensis) and two emergent macrophytes (Scolochloa festucacea and Scirpus lacustris) occurring on the drawdown surfaces of the experimental marshes (Nelson and Davis, 1986). \n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences: \nDavis, C.B. and van der Valk. 1978.

This data set includes belowground macrophyte production data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\tIn order to estimate net annual belowground macrophyte production, core samples of the belowground biomass were harvested in the late spring and in the fall. Shoot initiation early in the growing season depletes most of the belowground standing crop, and therefore spring sampling was done quickly (within 2 weeks) to capture this state. Underground biomass then reaches its seasonal maxima in the fall and was captured with the fall sampling. The resulting differences between the fall and spring standing crop biomass provided an estimate of net belowground macrophyte production (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Biomass by species and carbon and nitrogen pools of plants and soils were measured in 2002. Height and survivorship of spruce seedlings were measured in 1992, 1995, and 2002. White spruce  grew more rapidly in the presence of alder during the first six years.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 14", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "12", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002319", "characteristic": "pato:volume", "entity": "ecso:animal_skull", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "corina_logan.7.22"}, "eml": {"abstract": "In this study, we explored whether it is possible to validate a field proxy for brain size in great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) using the linear measurements of skulls. \n\nWe collected data from February through September 2014 on 42 great-tailed grackle skulls (see more information in the associated journal article: Logan & Palmstrom in review) obtained from the Museum of Southwestern Biology and the Ornithology Division of the KU Biodiversity Institute and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.\n\nWe obtained endocranial volumes using three methods:\n1) Linear measurement method - Linear measurements were collected using callipers as would be measured on a live bird in the field. We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

A stock post is the place where farmers keep, in most cases in an enclosure called a 'kraal', their animals at night and to which they return every evening after the day's herding.

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes belowground macrophyte production data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\tIn order to estimate net annual belowground macrophyte production, core samples of the belowground biomass were harvested in the late spring and in the fall. Shoot initiation early in the growing season depletes most of the belowground standing crop, and therefore spring sampling was done quickly (within 2 weeks) to capture this state. Underground biomass then reaches its seasonal maxima in the fall and was captured with the fall sampling. The resulting differences between the fall and spring standing crop biomass provided an estimate of net belowground macrophyte production (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

We were interested in the heritability of body size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus, family, and order?), in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic space?), and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate on the patterns seen today?  Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific on each continent, and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?).  These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on Body size in ecology and paleoecology:  linking pattern and process across space, time and taxonomic scales).  We began with the updated version of Wilson and Reeder's (1993) taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N = 4629 species) to which we added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible, we used an average of male and female body mass, which was in turn averaged over multiple localities to arrive at our species body mass values.  The sources are line referenced in the main data set, with the actual references appearing in a table within the metadata.  Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur on.  Please note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller compilations.  Although we relied heavily a data set for Chiroptera by K. E. Jones (N = 905), the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N = 688), and a data set compiled for South America by P. Marquet (N = 505), these total less than half the records in the current database.  The remainder are derived from more than 150 other sources (see reference table).  Furthermore, we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa, North and South America, and Australia (an additional 230 species). \"Late Pleistocene\" is defined as approximately 11 ka for Africa, North and South America, and as 50 ka for Australia, because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Overall, the temporal coverage is from the late Pleistocene to present (ca. 45,000 ybp to present). Estimates contained within this data set represent a generalized species value, averaged across gender and geographic space.  Consequently, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of body mass with specific environmental conditions is important.  All extant orders of mammals are included, as well as several archaic groups (N = 4859 species).  Because some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera), there are 5731 entries.  We have body masses for the following:  Artiodactyla (280 records), Bibymalagasia (2 records), Carnivora (393 records), Cetacea (75 records), Chiroptera (1071 records), Dasyuromorphia (67 records), Dermoptera (3 records), Didelphimorphia (68 records), Diprotodontia (127 records), Hydracoidea (5 records), Insectivora (234 records), Lagomorpha (53 records), Litopterna (2 records), Macroscelidea (14 records), Microbiotheria (1 record), Monotremata (7 records), Notoryctemorphia (1 record), Notoungulata (5 records), Paucituberculata (5 records), Peramelemorphia (24 records), Perissodactyla (47 records), Pholidota (8 records), Primates (276 records), Proboscidea (14 records), Rodentia (1425 records), Scandentia (15 records), Sirenia (6 records), Tubulidentata (1 record), and Xenarthra (75 records).  \n\nData has undergone substantial data quality and assurance checking, though this is an on-going process.  Histograms of the body masses of each order were produced, and values at the tails were double-checked for accuracy.  When multiple sources of information were available for a species, or new sources encountered, we used those with higher sample sizes and gender-specific information.\n\nHeaders are given here as header name followed by more information such as measurement units or other basic descriptor.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 146", "entityDescription": "",

In 1990, a year after the spill, concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons averaged nearly 4,000 ng g-1 dry weight of sediment at oiled sites compared to less than 700 ng g-1 at reference sites.  Injuries to eelgrass, if any, appeared to be slight and did not persist for more than a year after the spill.  There were possible impacts to the average density of shoots and flowering shoots, as these were 24% and 62% lower at oiled than at reference sites in 1990 (P<0.10 for both).  However, there were no differences between oiled and reference sites with respect to eelgrass biomass, seed density, seed germination, or the incidence of normal mitosis in seedlings, and there were no signs of the elimination of eelgrass beds.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage by sampling various treated and untreated sites in 2002. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.\nCitation: Lees, D.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 140", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "5", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002719", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Count", "entity": "ecso:sample", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-gce/246/20"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Daily summaries of climatological observations from the National Weather Service weather station on Sapelo Island, Georgia, were obtained from the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) covering the period 1958 through 2004.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C.

Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.

We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.\n\nAlaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:\nStudy History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. \n\nAbstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).\n\nPublications:\nAinley, D.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage by sampling various treated and untreated sites in 2002. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.\nCitation: Lees, D.

Eelgrass beds in heavily oiled bays were exposed to moderate concentrations of hydrocarbons.  In 1990, a year after the spill, concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons averaged nearly 4,000 ng g-1 dry weight of sediment at oiled sites compared to less than 700 ng g-1 at reference sites.  Injuries to eelgrass, if any, appeared to be slight and did not persist for more than a year after the spill.  There were possible impacts to the average density of shoots and flowering shoots, as these were 24% and 62% lower at oiled than at reference sites in 1990 (P<0.10 for both).  However, there were no differences between oiled and reference sites with respect to eelgrass biomass, seed density, seed germination, or the incidence of normal mitosis in seedlings, and there were no signs of the elimination of eelgrass beds.  Populations recovered from  possible injuries by 1991, as there was a sharp decline in hydrocarbon concentrations and there were no differences in shoot or flowering shoot densities between oiled and reference sites in 1990 or subsequent years.\n\nDean, T.A.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.\n\nPublications:\nHoover-Miller, A., C.

These data offered an opportunity to examine the species' growth characteristics by fitting asymptotic growth functions.  We adopted the concept of repeated measures data analysis, i.e., a combination of variance component analysis and growth curve fitting, the latter involved fitting the individual tree height and diameter data to a Weibull-based function.  A severe typhoon in 1996 caused serious damage to the plantation, mostly to tree heights.  To prevent this damage from influencing our results, we limited the analyses to those trees judged relatively free of typhoon damage, and focused on the diameter growth data.  Fitting a Weibull function with parameters a, b, and c was statistically successful (e.g. the mean R2 for diameter was 0.98).  Both analyses indicate substantial variation among provenances and families, and thus opportunities for genetic selection and breeding.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags.

Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours.

However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.\n\nWalker, C.M., D.

We\n        manipulated the sequence and timing of plant colonization in a\n        field experiment with 256 constructed vernal pool basins. Our\n        observations provided evidence for dispersal limitation,\n        priority effects, and frequency of colonization. Several\n        features of historical contingence affected the early formation\n        of vernal pool plant communities, but we also observed reversals\n        in community trajectories, suggesting that these effects may be\n        lost within a decade. Pools that received more seeds of native\n        species were less invaded, providing evidence for biotic\n        resistance, but this resistance was eventually overcome.\n        Constructed pools exhibited similar hydrology as reference\n        pools, and vernal pool species established populations in many\n        of the pools that were appropriately inundated. Further, seeding\n        increased native species abundance in constructed pools. In\n        summary, our research has revealed that colonization events,\n        pool hydrologic conditions, and biotic interactions all\n        influence the formation and persistence of vernal pool plant communities.", "attributeName": "c.plot.3.19.11", "entityDescription": "2001 constructed pool inundation depth data", "attributeDefinition": "Constructed pool, treatment plot inundation

We use goat faecal pellet density,degree of trampling and percentage bare-ground at distances from the stock post as a surrogate for a gradient in grazing pressure. A stock post is the place where farmers keep, in most cases in an enclosure called a 'kraal', their animals at night and to which they return every evening after the day's herding. Twenty-seven stock posts were located in the Richterverseveld National Park; nine stock posts on flats, footslops and mountains respectively. We measured plant species richness and diversity, and means percentage cover of the various plant groth forms (including the number of species falling into each growth from category) in each of the five 10 m x 10 m plots ( each 200 m part) demarcated along a transect of one kilolometre length from the centre of each stock post. The results show that the distance from the stock post does effect grazing intensity use because densities in faecal pellets rapidly declined with increasing distances away from stock post fot all habilitats studient.Grazing increase vegetation patchiness up to 800 m from the stock post for all the habitats.

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

Moths have been         used as indicators in a variety of diferent terrestrial         ecosystems, such as rainforests, temperate forests and         agri-ecosystems. We sampled the moth assemblages at canopy and         ground level at five sites within a 25 ha plot, at Robson Creek,         Atherton. Two Pennsylvania light traps were run simultaneously         on each trapping night, with one trap at ground level and one in         the canopy. Vertical stratification of moth species, between the         ground and canopy levels, can result in distinct ground and         canopy fauna.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 150", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "4", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002144", "characteristic": "pato:depth", "entity": "ecso:vernal_pool", "ent_no": "18", "pkg_id": "Collinge.3.34"}, "eml": {"abstract": "We studied ecological dynamics of vernal pool plant\n        communities in California, USA, focusing on: 1) effects of\n        dispersal limitation, order of colonization, and frequency of\n        colonization on plant community composition; 2) invasion of\n        vernal pools by non-native species, and 3) comparison of\n        restored vernal pools to naturally-occurring pools.

The primary goal of this monitoring, according to the technical appendix to the Long-Term Water Agreement (Green Book) are to detect any \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant decreases and changes in Owens Valley vegetation from conditions documented in 1984 to 1987\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Vegetation live cover and species composition documented during the 1984-87 mapping effort were adopted as the baseline for comparison with each annual reinventory according to the Agreement.  The reference measurements collected within individual areas mapped with similar vegetation (parcels) are referred to as baseline.\n\nThe Green Book details certain decreases and changes in vegetation community types that must be avoided under the Agreement.  Baseline vegetation communities in which evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation were classified as groundwater-dependent communities and are referred to as Types B, C, and D.  These phreatophytic communities are dependent on shallow groundwater to maintain plant populations, as precipitation alone is inadequate to meet the water demand of evaporation and transpiration (Sorensen et al. 1991, Steinwand et al. 2006).  For these parcels, according to the Green Book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe goal is to manage groundwater pumping and surface water management practices so as to avoid causing significant decreases in live vegetation cover\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to prevent a significant amount of vegetation from changing to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvegetation type that precedes it alphabetically (for example, Type D changing to either C, B, or A vegetation).\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The goal is to manage the effect of pumping on the depth to groundwater to maintain baseline plant communities.\n\nTo determine whether significant decreases and/or changes in vegetation have occurred, three criteria need to be met that are described in the Green Book: (1) measurability of vegetation change, (2) attributability of vegetation change to LADWP groundwater pumping or surface water management and (3) degree of significance defined by the magnitude, extent, duration and permanency of the change along with other factors including air quality, human health, impact to species of concern, etc. To avoid confusion, it is noteworthy to highlight that the standard dictionary definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeasurability\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the degree to which something can be measured.  Vegetation of course can be measured and thus the first criteria for determining significant decreases or changes in vegetation may seem to the reader unfamiliar with the Green Book, unnecessary.  However, the Green Book assigns a different definition to the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeasurability\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094defined in part as a change that is statistically significant.  Thus the first criteria, measurability, can be used interchangeably with statistical significance in the context of the technical appendix (Green Book) to the Agreement.  A main objective of the vegetation annual report is to evaluate the statistical significance (measurability) of vegetation change compared to baseline.  The second criterion, evaluating whether a statistically significant change in vegetation is caused by water management (attributability), is beyond the scope of this report owing to the need for a comprehensive analysis on a case by case basis for each vegetation parcel.  Another source of confusion may arise with the third criterion which is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdegree or significance\u00e2\u0080\u009d of environmental change.  For this criterion to be met, statistical significance is necessary but not sufficient.  As described above, there are several other factors in addition to statistical significance that must be demonstrated to evaluate the degree of significance for the third criterion.  For an example of a comprehensive evaluation of all three criteria for an individual parcel, see the report \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnalysis of Conditions in Vegetation Parcel Blackrock 94\u00e2\u0080\u009d (available at www.inyowater.org).\n\nA large proportion of groundwater-dependent parcels were mapped during baseline as Type C alkali meadows (61%), and the Agreement seeks to prevent these meadows from changing to shrub-dominated communities (Type B), a state change that is associated with increased depth to groundwater.  Alkali meadows are of special concern because small increases in depth to groundwater can decouple the groundwater from the root zone of grass species (Naumberg et al. 1996, Elmore et al. 2006).  Alkali meadow comprises 0.1% of the vegetation community types in California and 80% of alkali meadow communities are located within the Owens Valley (Davis et al. 1998).  Local management of this community type will determine the likelihood these ecosystems persist in a changing environment.  \n\nVegetation change across the Owens Valley was evaluated at both the valley scale and for each of 111 individual parcels sampled in 2013.  First, at the valley-wide scale we evaluated plant community cover and composition in parcels affected by groundwater pumping and for parcels that were relatively unaffected by groundwater pumping during the period of maximum pumping rate (1987-1993).  Second, we assessed whether transpiring vegetative cover differed over time for locations influenced by pumping compared to locations not influenced by groundwater pumping.  Third, we quantitatively assessed the divergence of these groups of parcels from the baseline cover values recorded from 1984 to 1987.  Fourth, we assessed whether vegetation composition in wellfield or control groups had changed from baseline values.  Lastly, since determination of significant impacts attributed to water management by LADWP is made on a case by case basis at the individual parcel scale, we (a) quantified the magnitude of change in perennial vegetation cover over the twenty-three year reinventory period, (b) assessed whether the relative proportion of woody vegetation (hereafter shrub), gramminoid vegetation (hereafter grass) and non-gramminoid herbaceous vegetation (hereafter herb) has changed compared to baseline and (c), quantified the temporal trends of vegetation composition for each parcel and evaluated what environmental factors explained the observed patterns in vegetation change.", "attributeName": "Grass", "entityDescription": "Line point transect data 1985-2013", "attributeDefinition": "Grass hits out of 100 possible", "entityName": "Transects.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "12", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00003359", "characteristic": "pato:elevation", "entity": "ecso:stream_channel_cross_section", "ent_no": "5", "pkg_id": "lusteve.53.12"}, "eml": {"abstract": "The rainfall amount and intensity of typhoon were rather different every year.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 74", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "4", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002039", "characteristic": "pato:concentration_of", "entity": "ecso:nitrogen", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-fce/1074/3"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Water quality samples are being collected using ISCO autosamplers at all wetland sites (that is, all sites except TS/Ph-9, 10, and 11).

These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these monthly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with an YSI conductivity meter.

Im urbanen Bereich entstehen diese Wunden oft durch Starkastschnitte (Fachamt 2010, S86f) .Es entstehen offene Wunden mit freigelegtem Kernholz die meist einfaulungen zeigen bevor sie \u00c3\u00bcberwallt werden k\u00c3\u00b6nnen. Auf der Versuchsflaeche sind nur natuerliche Astabbrueche zu beobachten. Totaeste der Innenkrone, Starkaeste an der Stammbasis oder in der Krone brechen aus und hinterlassen grosse Wunden die einfaulen und zu weiteren Abbruechen fuehren koennen. Grosse Wunden haben umfassende Hoehlungen zur Folge(Dietz et al., 2014), aus Sicht des Artenschutzes stellen diese Wunden wichtige Habitate dar. Erfasst werden Starkastbrueche ab 15 cm, diese koennen sofern sie ein faulen auch zu einem statischen Problem werden. Grosse Wunden haben umfassende Hoehlungen zur Folge(Dietz et al., 2014). Astabbrueche werden wie folgt kartiert: HKZ 21: initial, Starkastabbrueche die wenige Jahre bzw einige Monate alt oder Frisch sind und noch keine Faeule zeigen. SKZ 22: einfaulende Astabbrueche, das Holz zeigt bereits Befall mit Xylobionten. SKZ 23: eingefaulte Starkastabbrueche, es hat sich eine Hoehle mit Mulm gebildet SKZ 24: Phytotelmen (Wassertoepfe) sind Habitat fuer unzaehlige Arten, wobei lediglich die vorkommen von Schwebfliegen und Pseudoskorpionen genauer erforscht sind(Dietz,et.al.,2014), aber auch andere Insektenlarven sind hier zu finden. Dieses wenig erforschte Biotop wird bereits bei der Grunderfassung mitaufgenommen, Phytotelmen im Kronenbereich koennen nicht erfasst werden. 3 Risse Als Riss bezeichnet man das Aufreissen von Rinde und/oder Holzkoerper. Risse der Rinde unter Punkt 5 erfasst. Laengsrisse am Stamm (ZTV, 2006), an Staemmlingen oder Starkaesten entstehen durch mechanische oder thermische Einwirkungen, ursaechlich hierfuer sind i.d.R. Schwachstellen im Holzkoerper. Einzelne Risse in Stamm oder Kernholz sind hinsichtlich der Verkehrssicherheit meist unproblematisch, sofern sie ausgepraegte Ueberwallungen aufweisen, jedoch koennen auch ueberwallte Risse und ausgepraegte und Leisten, die auf erneutes aufreissen und anschliessende Ueberwallung hindeuten, auf Defekte im Stamm inneren hindeuten. Bei umfangreichen Schaeden im inneren besteht ausserdem die Gefahr eines Torsionsbruchs (Fachamt, 2010, S. 106f). Dietz et.al. Beschreiben vor allem Spalten(33) als herausragende Habitate Fledermaeuse wie z.B. den Grossen Abendsegler (Nyctalus noctula). Die Erfassung der Habitate erfolgt in 3.: SKZ 30: geschlossene Risse, diese koennen wieder aufreissen oder geben Hinweise auf bestehende innere Baumdefekte. Oftmals bilden sich, ueber die Jahre, Zentimeter lange Leisten. SKZ 31: Risse mit offen liegendem Kernholz SKZ 32: Risse mit ein faulendem Holz SKZ 33: Risse die grossflaechig ausgefault sind (Spalten) SKZ 34: schlecht ueberwallte Risse 4 Stammfusshoehlen Der Stammfuss ist der Bereich zwischen Wurzeln und Stamm (ZTV, 2006). Stammfusshoehlen entstehen durch Kernholz abbauende Pilze wie z.B. den kartierten Brandkrustenpilz. Bestehen Verkehrssicherungspflichten bleibt eine Ermittlung der Restwandstaerke oft nicht aus (Fachamt, 2010, S.98). Dietz et al. Schreiben in Artenschutz und Baumpflege, 2014: \u00e2\u0080\u009eDie Stammfusshoehle als Lebensstaette spezialisierter Arten, d.h. Mit grossem Mulmkoerper und Bodenfeuchte bzw. Mineralbodenanschluss ist im (Wirtschafts-)Wald die seltenste aller Strukturen.\u00e2\u0080\u009c Auch im Wirtschaftswald fehle es nicht an Initialhoehlen (4.1) diese Baeume werden aber oftmals entnommen bevor sich Hoehlen (4.2) entwickeln koennen(Dietz, 2014). Diese seltenen Habitate sind ueberlebenswichtig fuer eine Reihe besonders und streng geschuetzter Kaeferarten wie z.B.: den Juchtenkaefer( Osmoderma eremita) aber auch viele andere Schnell-, Bock- und Rosenkaeferarten (Wurst, 2012). Auch Fledermaeuse nutzen vor allem nach oben geschlossene Hoehlen als Quartiere (Dietz,2014). Stammfusshoehlen werden wie folgt kartiert: SKZ 41: Initialhoehlen, Schaeden am Stammfuss die sich zu Hoehlungen entwickeln koennen (z.B. Fruchtkoerper des Brandkrustenpilz an Wurzelanlaeufen. SKZ 42: offene Hoehlungen SKZ 43: geschlossene Hoehlungen SKZ 44: Hohlstamm ausgehend vom Stammfuss, ein Hohlstamm wurde dann festgestellt wenn das Kernholz bereits weitestgehend abgebaut wurde. 5 Rindenschaeden Abgestorbene Rindenpartien weisen auf eine Kambiumsch\u00c3\u00a4den hin, wobei der Holzkoerper aber nicht beeintraechtigt sein muss (Fachamt, 2010). Rindenschaeden koennen ausserdem auf defekte bzw. Insektenbefall im Stamminneren hinweisen. Rindenquartiere, in der Praxis oft auch als \u00e2\u0080\u009elose Rindenplacken\u00e2\u0080\u009c bezeichnet, kommen an grobborkigen Altbaeumen mit rissiger Rinde vor (M. Dietz et. al., 2014). Die Rinde steht oft grossflaechig, mehrere Zentimeter, vom Stamm ab. Diese Habitate koennen durch die Frasstaetigkeit von Grosskaeferlarven, z.B.: Larve des streng geschuetzten Heldbocks( Cerambyx cerdo) oder Pilzbefall entstehen. Sie bieten Vogel- und vor allem Fledermausarten wichtige, wenn auch recht kurzlebige Quartiere (Dietz et. al., 2014). Kartiert wurden grossflaechige Rindenschaeden, ab \u00c2\u00bd m\u00c2\u00b2 und lose Rindenplacken die potentielle Habitate fuer bspw: Fledermaeuse darstellen. SKZ 51: abgestorbene Rinde, weist auf Schaeden im Holzkoerper hin (FLL, 2010). SKZ 52 : Rindenquartiere, in der Praxis oft auch als \u00e2\u0080\u009elose Rindenplacken\u00e2\u0080\u009c bezeichnet. SKZ 53: oberflaechliche mechanische Schaeden die nur die Borke beschaedigen konnten, z.B. durch Starkastbruch an einem Nachbarbaum. Hier entstehen potentielle Habitate xylobionter Arten. SKZ 54: grossflaechige Schleimfluesse 6 Sonderstrukturen Gerade Altbaeume weisen unzaehlige Habitatstrukturen auf. Die in Punkt 1-9 beschriebenen Strukturen stellen die bei der Kartierung angefallenen Strukturen dar. Diese werden auch bei Dietz et. al., 2014 und in der Baumkontrollrichtlinie(FLL, 2010) genannt. Allerdings liefern Wissenschaft und Forschung gerade im Bereich der Baum- und Biodiversitaetsforschung staendig neue Erkenntnisse. Punkt 6 bietet Raum fuer zukuenftige Entwicklungen und territoriale Besonderheiten. Als Sonderstrukturen wurden am Edersee Kratz \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Kletterspuren des Waschbaeren (SKZ 62) kartiert. 7 geschaedigte Staemmlinge Ein Staemmling ist der Aus dem Stammkopf heraus, ueberwiegend aufrecht wachsende, kronenbildende Teil des Baumes (ZTV-2006). Geschaedigte und gebrochene Staemmlinge werden als gesonderte Strukturen erfasst, da sie mit direktem Anschluss an das Stammholz nach Abbruch oft zu Hohlstaemmen fuehren. SKZ 71: reibende Staemmlinge SKZ 72: abgebrochene Staemmlinge SKZ 73 :eingefaulte Staemmlinge SKZ 74: Hohlstamm von abgebrochenem Staemmling ausgehend 8 V-Zwiesel Als Zwiesel wird eine Gabelung in 2 ungefaehr Gleichstarke Staemmlinge bzw. Aeste bezeichnet. V-foermige Zwiesel weisen oftmals eingewachsene Rinde auf und koennen vermehrt bruchgefaehrdet sein (ZTV, 2006). Buchen neigen zur Bildung solcher Vergabelungen. V-Zwiesel haben keine gute Verbindung zueinander und brechen oft aus, vorher zeigt sich oft Kompensationswachstum. Erfasst werden: HKZ 81: V-Zwiesel, statisch unguenstige Vergabelungen HKZ 82: V-Zwiesel die bereits eingerissen sind 9 Totes Starkholz im Baum Der Totholzanteil im Bestand betraegt nach einer Schaetzung von HessenForst(2004) 6-15 Vfm je ha, Eine flaechendeckende Kartierung von Totholz in den erfassten Baeumen ist aufgrund des Arbeitsaufwandes ohne einen erheblichen Informationsgewinn nicht sinnvoll. Abgestorbene Schwach bis Starkaeste wurden nicht erfasst. Erfasst wurden abgestorbene Staemmlinge und Starkaeste ab 25cm Durchmesser. Diese wurden wie folgt kartiert: HKZ 91: Toter Starkast/Staemmling HKZ 92: Habitatholz (Toter Starkast/Staemmling mit erkennbaren Habitaten, z.B. Spechthoehlen) HKZ 93: Toter Starkast/Staemmling in der Oberkrone.", "attributeName": "Hoehe", "entityDescription": "Defektsymptome und Habitatstrukturen", "attributeDefinition": "Hoehe der Struktur Lotrecht vom Erdboden aus.Angabe in ganzen Metern.", "entityName": "Strukturen1-46.txt", "unit": "meter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "4", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002941", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Name", "entity": "ecso:treatment_protocol", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "doi:10.5063/AA/connolly.252.3"}, "eml": {"abstract": "The file pex09.xls refers to production data from plots in USFS Study FSRM 1706-09 that were not formally included in that study. A copy of the Study Plan may be obtained at http://ag.arizona.edu/SRER/study09/study09.txt. The file contains net aboveground production data for perennial and annual grasses.\n\nDuring Study 1706-09 measurements were taken on 12 pairs of sample plots in each of 6 pastures. Two permanent 100-ft. line transects were established at each plot location. Estimates were on two 8x24 ft. subplots centered over each transect (with long axis along the transect). Each pair of plots was located at one of three distances from water and on one of two kinds of soil.\n\nEach pasture was subjected to one of three livestock grazing treatments. Pastures 3 and 5N were grazed during the winter dormant season (approximately November through April). Pastures 5S and 12B were grazed during the summer growing season (approximately May through October). Pastures 2N and 6B were grazed yearlong.\n\nOne transect in each plot was a control, but all mesquite (Prosopis velutina) within 50 ft. of the other was killed.\n\nThis file contains measurements taken from 1967-1969 and in 1971. In 1967-1969 only the sample plots containing live (untreated) mesquite were read (12 per pasture). In 1971 four sample plots with live mesquite were read in each pasture.\n\nHerbage production was estimated in autumn as soon as possible after the end of the summer growing season. Production estimates were adjusted for utilization where necessary. Field weights were estimated in grams, then converted to dry weights using factors developed from double sampling. Dry weights were then converted into air-dry pounds per acre (to the nearest pound).\n\nTaxa were recorded separately to the species level in most cases and sometimes to the genus level only. The OTHERPG code refers to unidentified perennial grass species; ANNGRASS to all annual grass species. In this study ARIS refers to the Aristida genus (specifically tall threeawns).\n\nA value of -9999 in a field means that no data were available because a reading was not made for that date. A value of -99 in a field means that the datum is unknown.\n\nDue to the method used to calculate air-dry pounds per acre a zero entry may have one of two meanings: 1) The species did not occur at all in the plots, or 2) The species occurred in a quantity too small to round up to one pound per acre. The significance of a particular zero entry cannot be inferred from the table; field sheet review would be necessary.\n\nSources of data were original field data sheets with the following exception: Air-dry pounds per acre were not calculated for 1968-1969 and 1971, so these amounts were calculated by applying the factors to grams per 96 sq. ft. plot on the field data sheets.", "attributeName":

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 86", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "9", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002417", "characteristic": "pato:linear_density", "entity": "ecso:spawning_fish_density", "ent_no": "4", "pkg_id": "df35b.159.6"}, "eml": {"abstract": "MDN and delivered by salmon and other anadromous fishes are considered important drivers in riverine ecosystems, providing nutrients and food to these land-based food webs.

The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896.

The species within these communities were divided up into functional guilds and life history groups to further explain the presence of species at certain positions along the catena.  To sample herpetofaunal diversity, trap arrays were set up at the crest and valley bottom in four marula-knobthorn sites in the Skukuza landscape type, Kruger National Park, South Africa.  In addition, active searching was done to further sample the presence of herpetofauna at each site.  Soil characteristics and ground cover measures were collected at each site.  Data from this study (November 2009) was pooled with data from biodiversity surveys carried out in January 2009.  A total of 366 frogs frogs across 14 species and 43 reptiles across 12 species were captured in either the pitfall traps or identified during active searching.

The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896.

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 44", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "76", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002288", "characteristic": "pato:frequency", "entity": "taxa:Trifolium_microdon", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "Collinge.3.34"}, "eml": {"abstract": "We studied ecological dynamics of vernal pool plant\n        communities in California, USA, focusing on: 1) effects of\n        dispersal limitation, order of colonization, and frequency of\n        colonization on plant community composition; 2) invasion of\n        vernal pools by non-native species, and 3) comparison of\n        restored vernal pools to naturally-occurring pools.

We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.\n\nAlaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:\nStudy History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. \n\nAbstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).\n\nPublications:\nAinley, D.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 57", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "48", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002688", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Proportion", "entity": "ecso:plant", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "doi:10.5063/AA/sev.145.2"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Plant cover estimates were collected from Bouteloua grasslands at 3 different LTER (SGS, SEV, JRN) sites in summer of 1996/1997.

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem. \n\nPublications: \nSalomon, A.K. 2006.

By using trace element signatures of edge portions of juvenile herring otoliths, we identified the otolith chemical signature of individual rearing bays within Sitka Sound. We used trace element signatures of edge portions of adult herring otoliths to identify the otolith chemical signature of spawning areas within Sitka Sound. We also used trace element signatures of edge portions to compare to core portions of juvenile and adult herring to identify source and sink habitat in Sitka Sound. The results of the technique used in this project indicate that herring use different and distinct habitats in Sitka Sound during their life. Once we know which population contributes more to the spawning groups, we can then identify those variables that enhance the life histories of the source population. This will allow managers to protect the most important populations and also identify which variables can be altered to improve habitat f or other populations. These techniques used in Sitka Sound can be directly transferred to Prince W illiam Sound, leading to better identification\nof essential fish habitat in Prince William Sound.\n\n***Data here include otolith microchemistry, for data on herring sampling see project df35b.80.10 at http://evos.nceas.ucsb.edu/#view/df35b.80.10", "attributeName": "Ba138", "entityDescription": "Otolith chemistry data", "attributeDefinition": "Barium 138 concentration measured in micrograms per gram", "entityName": "sitkaOtolithData.csv", "unit": "microgramsPerGram"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "4", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002796", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Identifier", "entity": "ecso:sampling_site", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-gce/319/24"}, "eml": {"abstract": "A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2009 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 10 GCE LTER sampling sites.

By 1997, two population stocks were identified, based largely on genetic differences, but also on regional differences in morphology and population trends (Bickham et al., 1996; Loughlin, 1997). The western stock, which breeds and gives birth on rookeries from 144 W (approximately at Cape Suckling, just east of Prince William Sound, Alaska) westward to Russia and Japan, was listed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cendangered\u00e2\u0080\u009d in June 1997 (62 Federal Register 24345, May 5, 1997) because of persistent 5% per year declines through the 1990s. The eastern stock, which occurs from Southeast Alaska southward to California, remained classified as threatened in 1997, but has been increasing at 3% per year since at least the mid-1970s (Pitcher et al., 2007), and was removed from the list of threatened species in November 2013 (78 FR 66140) . The Steller sea lion Recovery Plan (NMFS, 2008) contains recovery criteria for de-listing both stocks (removal from the list of threatened and endangered species) and down-listing the western stock from endangered to threatened. NMFS (2008) also assessed the threats to recovery for both stocks, and determined that there were no threats to recovery for the eastern stock  , while for the western stock, nutritional stress resulting from competition with fisheries or environmental variability, and predation by killer whales were listed as potentially high threats to recovery, and effects of contaminants or pollutants was listed as a medium threat (largely due to significant data gaps). \n\nPopulation assessment for Steller sea lions in Alaska is currently achieved by aerial photographic surveys of pups and non-pups (adults and juveniles at least 1 year-old) during the breeding season (June-July).   Abundance trends are estimated using the methods of Johnson and Fritz (2014).

The strength of these effects can be regulated in part by predator abundance and nutrient availability. In 2009, we hypothesized that the importance of these factors varies geographically between the southeastern Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast due to differences in tidal regime, and began to study this variation using a biogeographic, manipulative field experiment. Although our original purpose was to understand the structure of salt marsh arthropod food webs, BP's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf Coast presented an opportunity to understand how stress from an oil spill might affect the variables that we were measuring. The fact that we had plots and transect sampling in place at multiple sites along the Gulf and East Coasts put us in a position to evaluate any impacts that might occur if oil hit some of the sites. The study was conducted at 11 sites across the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida, and 11 sites along the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Maine. At each site, experimental plots were sampled and a 100m transect was sampled near the plots within 5m of the high marsh boundary. Sampling was conducted in May 2009, August 2009, and August 2010.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. Sites were re-assessed in 2010 to test for long term effects of treatment. The major purposes of this study were to monitor recovery and compare bivalve abundance patterns to those observed in 2002.  As such, the 39 sites occupied during this study were specifically those sampled in the EVOS TC 2002 study (Lees and Driskell 2007).  GPS coordinates and site photographs from the 2002 study were used to reoccupy the same area to the degree allowable by tide levels at the time of sampling.  One site, Northwest Bay West Arm, was deleted from this suite of sites on the understanding that NOAA would sample it during a complementary study.  That site ultimately was not sampled.  The data here represent the bivalve survey results from these assessments. Note: This is an assessment of the bivalves, although various non-bivalve species are included in both data sets. These species were excluded from any of the analyses under this project but are available here for further analysis.  Additionally, although mussel Mytilus trossulus are included in both data sets, this species was also excluded from any of the analyses as it is an epifaunal organism that would only confuse analyses of the infaunal bivalves.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 85", "entityDescription": "",

"Swarms of the salp, Thalia democratica, periodically occur off southeast Australia following the austral spring bloom of phytoplankton. This study aimed to determine the abundance and size/stage distribution of T. democratica and their relationship with copepods in three water types of the western Tasman Sea. Samples were taken from vertical net hauls along four cross-shelf transects spaced along 200 km of the New South Wales coast, from the East Australian Current (EAC) separation zone, around 32.5\u00baS to off Sydney (34\u00baS). Temperature-salinity signatures grouped stations into three distinct water types: inner shelf water, EAC, and upwelled water. Although common across all stations, T. democratica was significantly more abundant within inner shelf waters compared to both EAC and upwelled water. Analysis of population structure (aggregate buds, aggregate females, aggregate males, immature solitaries and mature solitaries) also identified higher proportions of reproductive aggregates and their offspring in inner shelf water. This salp population structure was significantly different in the EAC regions, characterised by a paucity of the solitary stages, higher temperatures and lower chlorophyll a concentrations. A weak negative correlation was identified between T. democratica and copepod abundance. In this study, the maximum abundance of T. democratica was twice the highest global recorded abundance and tenfold greater than maximum abundances sampled from the continental shelf and slope waters off southeast Australia during 1938-42.", "attributeName": "depth_integrated_nitrogen", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "Depth-integrated nitrogen-specific biomass per square meter", "entityName": "JEDI Template.txt", "unit": "milligramsPerSquareMeter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "8", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002417", "characteristic": "pato:linear_density", "entity": "ecso:spawning_fish_density", "ent_no": "4", "pkg_id": "df35b.159.6"}, "eml": {"abstract": "MDN and delivered by salmon and other anadromous fishes are considered important drivers in riverine ecosystems, providing nutrients and food to these land-based food webs. However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.\n\nWalker, C.M., D.

Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of\n          observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and\n          resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic\n          regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but\n          that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological\n          responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems.\n      ", "attributeName": "s_NO3", "entityDescription": "water solute chemical concentrations over time", "attributeDefinition": "surface stream NO3", "entityName": "335_water_solute_timeseries_1.csv", "unit": "milligramsPerLiter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "6", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002414", "characteristic": "pato:concentration_of", "entity": "ecso:nitrite", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-fce/1069/5"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Porewater samples are collected at SRS1b,SRS2,SRS3, TS/Ph-1-5 within the 1 m^ aboveground sawgrass nondestructive biomass plots.

The characteristics of the digestion, chemical properties of the resulting pulp, and the handsheet physical properties were evaluated. As for the pulp yields, the method has high delignification specificity, at kappa number 20, the yield was ca. 60%, about 15~20% higher than the traditional alkaline pulping method. Furthermore, with increasing THFA concentrations, efficacies of delignification also increased. Increasing the catalyst dosage also caused an increase in delignification.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray.

Spurious or non-causal correlations between aggregate personality and aspects of climate and culture that influence T. gondii transmission could also drive these patterns. A link between culture and T. gondii hypothetically results from a behavioral manipulation that the parasite uses to increase its transmission to the next host in the life cycle: a cat. While latent toxoplasmosis is usually benign, the parasite's subtle effect on individual personality appears to alter the aggregate personality at the population level. Drivers of the geographical variation in the prevalence of this parasite include the effects of climate on the persistence of infectious stages in soil, the cultural practices of food preparation and cats as pets.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.\nCitation: Lees, D.

A copy of the Study Plan may be obtained at http://ag.arizona.edu/SRER/study09/study09.txt.\n\nMeasurements were taken annually from 1957-1966 and in 1970 on 12 pairs of sample plots in each of 6 pastures. Each pair of plots was located at one of three distances from water and on one of two kinds of soil.\n\nEach pasture was subjected to one of three livestock grazing treatments. Pastures 3 and 5N were grazed during the winter dormant season (approximately November through April). Pastures 5S and 12B were grazed during the summer growing season (approximately May through October). Pastures 2N and 6B were grazed yearlong.\n\nTwo permanent 100-ft. line transects were established at each plot location. One transect in each plot was a control, but all mesquite (Prosopis velutina) within 50 ft. of the other was killed.\n\nHerbage production was estimated in autumn as soon as possible after the end of the summer growing season. Estimates were on two 8x24 ft. subplots centered over each transect (with long axis along the transect). Production estimates were adjusted for utilization where necessary. Field weights were estimated in grams, then converted to dry weights using factors developed from double sampling. Dry weights were then converted into air-dry pounds per acre (to the nearest pound).\n\nPerennial grass data is recorded by genus or species. All species of annual grasses were combined into one measurement.\n\nSources of data were original field data sheets and a printout of previously digitized data.\n\nTaxa were recorded separately to the species level in most cases and sometimes to the genus level only. The OTHERPG code refers to unidentified perennial grass species; ANNGRASS to all annual grass species. When measurements are entered for OTHERPG, the species and genera to which they refer are not consistent. In this study ARIS refers to the Aristida genus (specifically tall threeawns).\n\nA value of -9999 in a field means that no data were available because a reading was not made for that date. A value of -99 in a field means that the datum is unknown.\n\nDue to the method used to calculate air-dry pounds per acre, a zero entry may have one of two meanings: 1) The species did not occur at all in the plots, or 2) The species occurred in a quantity too small to round up to one pound per acre.

Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of\n          observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and\n          resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic\n          regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but\n          that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological\n          responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems.\n      ", "attributeName": "s_NH4", "entityDescription": "water solute chemical concentrations over time", "attributeDefinition": "surface stream NH4", "entityName": "335_water_solute_timeseries_1.csv", "unit": "milligramsPerLiter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "58", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002719", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Count", "entity": "ecso:sample", "ent_no": "2", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-gce/287/26"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Conductivity, temperature and pressure were measured continuously at Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER sampling location GCE8_Hydro (Altamaha River near Aligator Creek, Georgia) from 01-Jan-2005 through 31-Dec-2005.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 144", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv undentifed natantian species 1", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "5", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002801", "characteristic": "pato:flow_rate", "entity": "envo:stream", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-fce/1205/1"}, "eml": {"abstract": "The following abstract is from Sandoval (2013).

The advantage of using the Plot as a point of focus is that the mapping and plant community data provide a phenological and ecological context for interpreting drivers of the bird community at that site. The Robson Creek plot site was chosen because being situated at c. 700m it represents a \u00e2\u0080\u0098tension\u00e2\u0080\u0099 zone between different tropical forest communities that are likely to show shifts under climate change. Bird communities below 600-800m can be characterised as current lowland, warm climate communities while those above 600-800m take on species with upland distributions, e.g. golden bowerbireds. grey-headed robins and fernwrens. Robson Creek being situated at the current altitudinal boundaries of the distribution of the upland and lowland specialist species consequently represents an ideal site for monitoring the species and community responses to climate change over time. In this project we are interested in species and community responses to climate change in three contexts. First, at the species level we are interested in how individual species respond in abundance and seasonality. Second, at the community level we are interested in i) describing changes in species distribution, ii) the effects of this on community composition and structure and iii) how this varies through the year.", "attributeName": "#_of_Observations", "entityDescription": "Bird Survey Data, Robson Creek, 2014", "attributeDefinition": "Number of individuals observed", "entityName": "asn_fnqr_robson_fauna_birds_2014.csv", "unit": "number"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "21", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002178", "characteristic": "pato:frequency", "entity": "taxa:Convolvulus_arvensis", "ent_no": "11", "pkg_id": "Collinge.3.34"}, "eml": {"abstract": "We studied ecological dynamics of vernal pool plant\n        communities in California, USA, focusing on: 1) effects of\n        dispersal limitation, order of colonization, and frequency of\n        colonization on plant community composition; 2) invasion of\n        vernal pools by non-native species, and 3) comparison of\n        restored vernal pools to naturally-occurring pools.

Spurious or non-causal correlations between aggregate personality and aspects of climate and culture that influence T. gondii transmission could also drive these patterns. A link between culture and T. gondii hypothetically results from a behavioral manipulation that the parasite uses to increase its transmission to the next host in the life cycle: a cat. While latent toxoplasmosis is usually benign, the parasite's subtle effect on individual personality appears to alter the aggregate personality at the population level. Drivers of the geographical variation in the prevalence of this parasite include the effects of climate on the persistence of infectious stages in soil, the cultural practices of food preparation and cats as pets. Some variation in culture, therefore, may ultimately be related to how climate affects the distribution of T. gondii, though the results only explain a fraction of the variation in two of the four cultural dimensions, suggesting that if T. gondii does influence human culture, it is only one among many factors.

Since most of N (Greater than 90%) and P (around 90%) is in the organic form in the oligotrophic subtropical Florida Coastal Estuaries (FCES), study of the source and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ecosystem is crucial for the better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.  FCES are composed of estuaries with distinct regions with different biogeochemical processes.  Florida Bay (FB) is a wedge-shaped shallow oligotrophic estuary which lays south of the Everglades, the bottom of which is covered with a dense biomass of seagrass.  Whitewater bay (WWB) is a semi-enclosed mangrove estuary with a relatively long residence time, which receives overland freshwater input from the Everglades marshes.  Ten thousand Islands (TTI) covers the southwest margin of the Florida Coastal Everglades, which are highly compartmentalized by local geomorphology.  The sources of both freshwater and nutrients in FCES are difficult to quantify, owing to the non-point source nature of runoff from the Everglades and the dendritic cross channels in the mangroves.  Furthermore, the combination of multiple DOM sources (freshwater marsh vegetation, mangroves, phytoplankton, seagrass, etc.), and the potential seasonal variability of their relative contribution, along with the history of (photo)chemical and microbial diagenetic processing, and complex advective circulation, makes the study of DOM dynamics in FCES particularly difficult using standard schemes of estuarine ecology.  Quantitative information of DOM is very useful to investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DOM to a certain degree, however, qualitative information is necessary to better understand the source and dynamics of DOM.

How to increase the taxol yield in Taxus cell cultures has been viewed to be a great economical potential. Since taxol yield is low in plants and cell cultures, the greater amounts of two taxoids: 10-deactyl baccatin III (DB) and bacctin III (BC) were then used to be precursors that were synthesized to form taxol. To increase the taxoid yield in cell cultures, a good cell line and methyl jasnomate (MJ) treatment were proven to be effective in many studies. In our study, MJ is not only to increase taxoid yield, but also increase the kinds of taxoids. We presumed that MJ might be a good indicator to select important genes among the tens genes in taxol biosynthesis. We selected and cloned genes of taxadiene synthase (TS) and 10-deacetyl baccatin III-10-O-acetyl transferase (DBAT). TS is the first gene of taxol biosynthesis pathway, while DBAT gene controls the reaction of DB to become BC. We found the overexpression of these two genes in both needles and stems of Taxus mairei plants 8 hours after MJ treatment, indicating that transforming these two genes in cell cultures might increase taxoid yield. The construction of 35S promoter and sense DBAT, sense TS, and antisens DBAT gene were made and successfully transformed them into cell cultures.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full.

Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of\n          observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and\n          resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic\n          regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but\n          that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological\n          responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems.\n      ", "attributeName": "s_SRP", "entityDescription": "water solute chemical concentrations over time", "attributeDefinition": "surface stream soluble reactive\n            phosphate", "entityName": "335_water_solute_timeseries_1.csv", "unit": "microgramsPerLiter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "6", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002439", "characteristic": "pato:depth", "entity": "ecso:sample", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-ntl/26/9"}, "eml": {"abstract": "These data are collected to document and characterize the submersed macrophytes of Trout Lake, to evaluate the long-term stability of this component, and to interface with investigations of other compartments of the ecosystem.

The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.\n\nWalker, C.M., D.

The survey encompasses a major portion of the eastern Bering Sea shelf between the 20-m and the 200-m isobaths and from the Alaska Peninsula north to approximately the latitude of St. Matthew Island (60 degrees 50 minutes N).\n\nThese jellyfish data came from quantitative bottom trawl surveys of the EBS shelf conducted by the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) division of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), NOAA (data owner: Robert Lauth).  Since 1979, jellyfish have been collected annually during the period May 22 - Aug 19.  The survey of 356-376 stations arranged in a grid-like pattern takes approximately 2 months for 2 fishing vessels to complete.  A ~17-m wide, ~2.6 m high trawl is towed on the bottom for 30 min.  Because jellyfish are mostly distributed throughout the water column, their capture in the bottom trawl gear is likely occurring during the net retrieval operation.  We assume that these records, though not representative of the actual jellyfish abundance, can accurately represent the temporal and spatial variation throughout the study region. Although taxonomic data were not collected on the jellyfish caught, species composition data from recent years suggest that most of the biomass (>85%) consisted of one species, Chrysaora melanaster (Brodeur et al. 2002; Acuna, unpublished data).  Catches less than about 1150 kg were sorted and weighed completely. Larger catches were subsampled before processing.  Biomass density for each taxon was expressed as kg per ha of area swept by the trawl (distance fished x net width). \n\nCatches of all large jellyfish (medusae) are weighed and standardized to catch per unit effort (CPUE in kg per ha, where 1 ha = 10,000 square meters) (see Brodeur et al., 1999, for details).  Station-by-station CPUE data can be provided upon request.  The annual data provided for the JEDI database are in the form of a biomass index (units: 1000s of metric tons).  This biomass index was calculated for the survey area, adjusting for the area within each of six geographic areas (i.e., strata).  These jellyfish biomass estimates were made by expanding the mean density within each of six strata to the total area of the strata and summing over all areas.  Even though medusae are most likely to be captured during deployment or retrieval (as expressed above), the use of density is believed to be appropriate for this biomass index. \n\nMost references to density of pelagic zooplankton are expressed in weight per 1000 cubic meters of water filtered.  For purposes of comparison an average tow in this survey filters approximately 124,000 cubic meters.  However, the actual water filtered during deployment and retrieval is unknown and therefore the index concept is more appropriate for purposes of annual comparisons.\n\nTemperature profiles were taken at each station using an expendable bathy-thermograph (XBT) or a Sea-Bird micro-bathythermograph (MBT) attached to the headrope of the net.

Over the past 50 years the Northern Pacific appears to have undergone at least one clear regime shift, while the last 12 years have seen multi-years shifts of major atmospheric indices, leaving uncertainty about what regime the coastal Gulf of Alaska is currently in.

The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.\n\nWalker, C.M., D.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.\n\nPurpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.\n\nDescription of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.\n\nPublications:\nHoover-Miller, A., C.

The highest rate was measured with the in situ buried-bag method fallowed by in situ tube method and the field leaching method. Of the three methods, the in situ tube method provided N-values which came close to theexpected ones when the litter N-input by vegetation, input/output balances and inventories were considered. Net C-mineralisation was measured with the leaching method and was lower than the input of C by plant litter suggesting that litter\nfrom fine roots and herbs which was not included in the field leaching method might have underestimated the C (and N) mineralisation of soils.\nProportions of net N-mineralisation and net C-mineralisation in the acid moderhumus from the Solling site were similar to those measured in the surface mineral soil of the less acid soil at the Go\u00c2\u00a8ttinger Wald site. High soil acidity at the Solling site has reduced the earthworm and microbial activity in its mineral soil and has shifted the microbial activity to the surface organic layer.\nLower C/N ratios of the mineralisation products than those of the soil organic matter suggest that a fraction of soil organic matter in the surface organic layer of the Solling soil with a high N concentration was preferential substrate for microbial respiration. This fraction might derive from immobilisation of atmospheric nitrogen in the surface organic layer.\nThe acid soil of the Solling site contains a high fraction of heterotrophic nitrifiers causing low relative nitrification rates between 12 and 51% of the mineral N produced. However, autotrophic nitrifiers are active in the less acid soil at the Go\u00c2\u00a8ttinger Wald site and are responsible for the transformation of more than 87%of net N-mineralisation to nitrate.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage by sampling various treated and untreated sites in 2002. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.\nCitation: Lees, D.

Annual estimates of the average fraction of the population hauled out are also advised.\n\nThis project is primarily a re-analysis of existing empirical data collected by the ADF&G and NMFS during studies to assess the population trend and abundance of harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska, including Prince William Sound. These data are primarily counts of harbor seals obtained from both aerial surveys and land-based\nmonitoring studies. Additional data include the geographic location of the seal haulout where the counts were obtained, and records of environmental variables associated with the count data: e.g., date, time, tidal stage.\n\nThe data here include NMFS survey and tag-and-recapture data, ADF&G data collected by Kathryn Frost, et al. has been archived in package df35b.71.9 and can be found at http://evos.nceas.ucsb.edu/evos/metacat/df35b.71.9/default\n\nAdkison, M.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 101", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv unidentifed species 1", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "61", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002688", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Proportion", "entity": "ecso:plant", "ent_no": "2", "pkg_id": "doi:10.5063/AA/sev.145.2"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Plant cover estimates were collected from Bouteloua grasslands at 3 different LTER (SGS, SEV, JRN) sites in summer of 1996/1997.

All cultural material (except shell) were collected and put in labeled plastic bags. Only some shell samples were kept for future analysis. Ceramics were classified to determine surface treatment/ decoration, temper, and rim form, with the ultimate goal of determining their period of use.

We measured fluxes at permanent plots established from the center of the bog into the surrounding burn at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 m on the east and west side of the transect. Flux measurements on either side of the transect were treated as replicates. CO2 and H2O fluxes were measured using a Li-840 infrared gas analyzer (Licor Inc., Lincoln, NB, USA). The IRGA was calibrated before each trip to the field using a span of 400 ppm and a zero of N2 gas. We logged data every 0.5 seconds for 2 min. To account for measurement variability, we conducted two measurements in succession at each location, after flushing the chamber for accumulated CO2 and H2O. For the flux measurements, we built plexiglass chambers with pipe insulation bases with dimensions of 61 x 61 x 30.5 cm, 61 x 61 x 61 cm, or 61 x 61 x 122 cm. The shorter chambers were used in the collapse portion of the transect. Chambers included fans for air circulation, inlet and outlet ports for CO2 measurements, or just outlet ports for CH4 measurements (Carroll and Crill 1997). We placed chambers directly on the soil surface and used pipe insulation and plastic sheeting to make a solid seal during the measurement. To estimate the volume for each chamber measurement, we measured the distance to the soil surface from a 6 cm grid suspended 30 cm above each plot, the surface area was then used to calculate the chamber volume for each measurement. Dark measurements were used to determine CO2 derived from soil and root respiration (ecosystem respiration) using a two-layer cloth shroud with a reflective surface to exclude solar radiation. To estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, we conducted chamber measurements of plant and soil respiration and plant uptake. NEE data are not reported as NEEmax (NEE at PAR greater then 1000 umol m-2 s-1) as PAR only once surpassed 1000 umol m-2 s-1 during field measurement trips in 2004. Smoke from wildfires through July and August reduced PAR and likely influenced relationships between PAR and NEE. After experimenting with different incubation lengths, we conducted 40 min methane flux measurements to compensate for low flux rates and large chambers. Syringe samples were taken after deploying the chamber and at 8 min intervals, yielding 6 gas samples. We analyzed gas samples using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest.

Phase II commenced in the fall of 1989 and continued through the summer of 1991. The supratidal component was completed in 1991 and a final report was submitted separately. The subtidal portion was integrated into a suite of other subtidal studies and findings were also reported separately. Draft preliminary status reports were issued for the intertidal componenet in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 by Highsmith et al. as Coastal Habitat Study No. 1: Phase II in 1990 and 1991 and No. 1A in 1992 and 1993.\n\nAbstract: The Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment Study was initiated to assess injury to intertidal habitats impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The study, conducted from 1989-1991, encompassed three major geographical areas impacted by the spill: Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet-Kenia Peninsula and Kodiak-Alaska Peninsula. Oiled sites were selected randomly and matched with non-oiled sites and classified into sheltered rocky, exposed rocky, coarse textured or estuarine habitat. Statistically significant differences between oiled and non-oiled sites were interpreted as impact due to the spill and/or clean-up activities. Most observed differences varied across regions, habitats and tidal heights. Algae, especially the perennial Fucus, was generally negatively impacted on oiled sites. Conversely, an increase in annual and ephemeral species in the lower intertidal occurred. Limpets, mussels, littorines, and the high cockscomb prickleback were injured by the spill, while oligochaetes and a single barnacle species were enhanced at most tidal heights following the spill. Although intertidal communities showed widespread impact from oiling/clean-up activities for algal, invertebrate and fish components, data revealed most habitats were recovering but had fully recovered by 1991. \n\nPublications:\nHighsmith, R.C., M.S.

The strength of these effects can be regulated in part by predator abundance and nutrient availability. In 2009, we hypothesized that the importance of these factors varies geographically between the southeastern Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast due to differences in tidal regime, and began to study this variation using a biogeographic, manipulative field experiment. Although our original purpose was to understand the structure of salt marsh arthropod food webs, BP's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf Coast presented an opportunity to understand how stress from an oil spill might affect the variables that we were measuring. The fact that we had plots and transect sampling in place at multiple sites along the Gulf and East Coasts put us in a position to evaluate any impacts that might occur if oil hit some of the sites. The study was conducted at 11 sites across the Gulf Coast, from Texas to Florida, and 11 sites along the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to Maine.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 118", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "23", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002041", "characteristic": "pato:concentration_of", "entity": "ecso:phosphorus", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-ntl/281/2"}, "eml": {"abstract": "These data were collected by Stephen Michael Powers and collaborators for his Ph.d.\n\t\t\t\tresearch, documented in his dissertation: River Nutrient Uptake and Transport Across\n\t\t\t\tExtremes in Channel Form and Drainage Characteristics.

However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 79", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "7", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002719", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Count", "entity": "ecso:sample", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/ecotrends/720/2"}, "eml": {"abstract": "\nThe EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters \n(Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and \nDr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo  LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) \nto support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. \nThe project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility \nand use of long-term data.

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al.

(1996). \n\nAbstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.", "attributeName": "species_description", "entityDescription": "Zooplankton length data from sampling at Red, Upper Station and Akalura lakes, with varying dates.

Leaf area index (LAI) can be defined as the total one sided area of leaf tissue per unit area of ground and is a key derived parameter that is associated with water and light interception, radiation transfer, water and carbon exchange (Bre\u00cc\u0081da, 2003). Canopy cover can be defined as the fraction of ground shaded by the vertical projection of tree crowns (Walker et al. 1981). These measures may be used as proxies for actual canopy leaf area. Leaf area index is the preferred measure of cover for vegetation and as a key variable used in total biomass estimation and in carbon cycling prediction models. Indirect measures of LAI include digital photographic methods using flat or hemispherical images, referred to respectively as DCP (digital cover photography) and DHP (digital hemispheric photography).  LAI measurements are carried out at each SuperSite using the most appropriate method for the vegetation type present. Digital Cover Photography (DCP) is recommended for medium stature (10-40 m) vegetation with simple structure. DCP was originally developed for sparse to moderately dense broadleaf forest and has also been tested in sparse savanna woodland. DCP is recommended for these vegetation types and has also been suggested for more dense forests (Pekin and MacFarlane 2009).  Digital Hemispheric Photography (DHP) is recommended for short vegetation (4-8 m) e.g. low banksia woodland, complex (multi strata) and tall vegetation (> 40+ m) using images taken 20 m apart (MacFarlane et al. 2007).", "attributeName": "plot", "entityDescription": "Canopy Leaf Area Index Data, Samford, November 2014", "attributeDefinition": "Plot Name", "entityName": "asn_seqp_samford_veg_lai_data_core_1_ha_20141111.csv", "unit": ""}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "10", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002719", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Count", "entity": "ecso:sample", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/ecotrends/14261/2"}, "eml": {"abstract": "\nThe EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters \n(Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and \nDr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo  LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) \nto support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. \nThe project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility \nand use of long-term data.

Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,\n          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem\n          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are\n          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,\n          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials\n          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain\n          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of\n          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen\n          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert\n          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic\n          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are\n          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple\n          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors\n          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with\n          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently\n          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to\n          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot\n          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil\n          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry\n          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of\n          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,\n          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity\n          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to\n          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to\n          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following\n          inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of\n          observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and\n          resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic\n          regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but\n          that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological\n          responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems.\n      ", "attributeName": "s_DON", "entityDescription": "water solute chemical concentrations over time", "attributeDefinition": "surface stream organic N", "entityName": "335_water_solute_timeseries_1.csv", "unit": "milligramsPerLiter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "16", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00003359", "characteristic": "pato:elevation", "entity": "ecso:stream_channel_cross_section", "ent_no": "3", "pkg_id": "lusteve.53.12"}, "eml": {"abstract": "The rainfall amount and intensity of typhoon were rather different every year.

The absolute values of scouring-deposition depths increased as channel stability indicators increased and channel stability coditions become worse.

Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression.

This mixing zone is considered to be geochemical important in a carbonate aquifer as an area of enhanced carbonate mineral dissolution and,or precipitation.  Ion exchange reactions are also common within the mixing zone as the dominant cation in seawater, sodium, replaces other ions adsorbed to the aquifer matrix.  Phosphorus has a strong affinity for adsorption to calcium carbonate minerals.  Both the dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals as well as ion exchange reactions have the potential to release phosphorus from the aquifer matrix to the groundwater.  Discharge of this phosphorus-laden groundwater, as induced by the fresh/saline water interface, may then be an additional source of phosphorus to the overlying coastal environments.  Both surface water and groundwater were collected across the seawater intrusion zone of the coastal Everglades in south Florida during the summer of 2003. Hydrogen sulfide was released from the groundwater wells during sampling, indicating the groundwater was most likely anoxic.  In order to reduce the potential exposure of the groundwater to oxygen during sampling, groundwater samples were collected in the following manner.  Groundwater wells were first purged of at least three well volumes prior to sampling.  Water samples were then collected using a submersible pump with a 16-gauge needle fitted at the end of the discharge hose.  The needle was pushed through a rubber stopper covering an acid-washed vacutainer that was first flushed with nitrogen gas to remove and oxygen, then evacuated with a vacuum pump to establish a negative pressure within the vacutainer.  Water samples were stored on ice and transported to the laboratory.  Samples were processed for total phosphorus using colorimetery following dry-oxidation/acid hydroloysis methods within 1 to 5 days following sample collection.  Salinity of the groundwater and surface water was determined at the time of sampling using an Orion S-C-T meter.  Total phosphorus concentrations in 11 groundwater wells ranged from 0.5 to 2.3 uM (16 to 73.6 ug/L-P).  Concentrations of total phosphorus in the overlying surface water were consistently lower and ranged from 0.16 to 0.45 uM (5.1 to 14.4 ug/L-P).  There was a strong positive correlation between total phosphorus concentrations in the groundwater with salinity (R2=0.6).

These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with a YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass.

A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes belowground macrophyte production data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.\n\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).\n\tIn order to estimate net annual belowground macrophyte production, core samples of the belowground biomass were harvested in the late spring and in the fall. Shoot initiation early in the growing season depletes most of the belowground standing crop, and therefore spring sampling was done quickly (within 2 weeks) to capture this state. Underground biomass then reaches its seasonal maxima in the fall and was captured with the fall sampling. The resulting differences between the fall and spring standing crop biomass provided an estimate of net belowground macrophyte production (van der Valk, 1989).\n\nFor further information on the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP), please visit: http://www.ducks.ca/conserve/research/projects/merp/index.html\n\nReferences:\nMurkin, H.R., B.D.J.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 46", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "69", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002688", "characteristic": "oboe-characteristics:Proportion", "entity": "ecso:plant", "ent_no": "3", "pkg_id": "doi:10.5063/AA/sev.145.2"}, "eml": {"abstract": "Plant cover estimates were collected from Bouteloua grasslands at 3 different LTER (SGS, SEV, JRN) sites in summer of 1996/1997.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

Each pair of plots was located at one of three distances from water and on one of two kinds of soil.\n\nEach pasture was subjected to one of three livestock grazing treatments. Pastures 3 and 5N were grazed during the winter dormant season (approximately November through April). Pastures 5S and 12B were grazed during the summer growing season (approximately May through October). Pastures 2N and 6B were grazed yearlong.\n\nTwo permanent 100-ft. line transects were established at each plot location. One transect in each plot was a control, but all mesquite (Prosopis velutina) within 50 ft. of the other was killed.\n\nHerbage production was estimated in autumn as soon as possible after the end of the summer growing season. Estimates were on two 8x24 ft. subplots centered over each transect (with long axis along the transect). Production estimates were adjusted for utilization where necessary.

Dry weights were then converted into air-dry pounds per acre (to the nearest pound).\n\nPerennial grass data is recorded by genus or species.

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al.

(1996). \n\nAbstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.", "attributeName": "nitrogen", "entityDescription": "Lake nutrient and physical parameter data from 1990 to 1996.

We recorded skull length from the base of the bill to the back of skull along the occipital crest (Figure 1). Skull height from posterior edge of the foramen magnum to the top of skull along the frontal region (Figure 2). And skull width at the widest part of the brain case along the squamosal bones (Figures 3) to the nearest 0.1mm.\n\n2) CT scan method - Skulls were CT scanned at the Pueblo Radiology Medical Group in Santa Barbara California using a Siemans 16-slice Somatom Sensation 16. Endocranial volume (cm3) was calculated using  the DICOM viewer OsiriX v5.8.5 (Figure 5) for 1x1mm slices (regular) and for 1x1mm slices that were taken with the CT scanner bed moved 0.5mm forward (offset). We used the average endocranial volume in analyses. The offset was added to increase the precision of the endocranial volume measurements since grackle skulls are small (approximately 20mm in length). This resulted in about 20 slices per scan (one slice every 1mm). The offset allowed us to measure more area (one slice every 0.5mm) by increasing the number of slices to approximately 40 per skull.\n\n3) Bead method - Endocranial volume was measured by pouring 1mm diameter glass beads (BioSpec Products, catalog number 11079110) into the cranium through the foramen magnum until full. The skull was repeatedly shaken to settle the beads and then filled again until the beads reached the posterior foramen magnum without falling out (Figure 4).

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 59", "entityDescription": "",

The survey encompasses a major portion of the eastern Bering Sea shelf between the 20-m and the 200-m isobaths and from the Alaska Peninsula north to approximately the latitude of St. Matthew Island (60 degrees 50 minutes N).\n\nThese jellyfish data came from quantitative bottom trawl surveys of the EBS shelf conducted by the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) division of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), NOAA (data owner: Robert Lauth).  Since 1979, jellyfish have been collected annually during the period May 22 - Aug 19.  The survey of 356-376 stations arranged in a grid-like pattern takes approximately 2 months for 2 fishing vessels to complete.  A ~17-m wide, ~2.6 m high trawl is towed on the bottom for 30 min.  Because jellyfish are mostly distributed throughout the water column, their capture in the bottom trawl gear is likely occurring during the net retrieval operation.  We assume that these records, though not representative of the actual jellyfish abundance, can accurately represent the temporal and spatial variation throughout the study region. Although taxonomic data were not collected on the jellyfish caught, species composition data from recent years suggest that most of the biomass (>85%) consisted of one species, Chrysaora melanaster (Brodeur et al. 2002; Acuna, unpublished data).  Catches less than about 1150 kg were sorted and weighed completely. Larger catches were subsampled before processing.  Biomass density for each taxon was expressed as kg per ha of area swept by the trawl (distance fished x net width). \n\nCatches of all large jellyfish (medusae) are weighed and standardized to catch per unit effort (CPUE in kg per ha, where 1 ha = 10,000 square meters) (see Brodeur et al., 1999, for details).  Station-by-station CPUE data can be provided upon request.  The annual data provided for the JEDI database are in the form of a biomass index (units: 1000s of metric tons).  This biomass index was calculated for the survey area, adjusting for the area within each of six geographic areas (i.e., strata).  These jellyfish biomass estimates were made by expanding the mean density within each of six strata to the total area of the strata and summing over all areas.  Even though medusae are most likely to be captured during deployment or retrieval (as expressed above), the use of density is believed to be appropriate for this biomass index. \n\nMost references to density of pelagic zooplankton are expressed in weight per 1000 cubic meters of water filtered.  For purposes of comparison an average tow in this survey filters approximately 124,000 cubic meters.  However, the actual water filtered during deployment and retrieval is unknown and therefore the index concept is more appropriate for purposes of annual comparisons.\n\nTemperature profiles were taken at each station using an expendable bathy-thermograph (XBT) or a Sea-Bird micro-bathythermograph (MBT) attached to the headrope of the net.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass.

However,the surface organic layer in moder humus adsorbed only a small amount of the applied ammonium whereas most was adsorbed in the mineral soil layers.Retention of ammonium by adsorption depended on soil temperature which was reduced at higher temperature by increasing nitrification, and was increased with\ndecreasing temperature by lowering nitrification. This mechanism potentially delayed leaching losses of applied ammonium as nitrates in acid soils especially at low temperatures in the nongrowing season and probably increased the uptake of N by microbes and plants.\nRetention of 15N labelled ammonium in organic compounds (microbial biomass,soil organic matter) was high when microbial biomass was high. The dominant effect of microbial immobilisation, which was independent of soil layers and humus forms, suggested the importance of the fate of microbial detritus for the long-term retention of deposited ammonium in forest soils.

The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.

Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. The disturbance was the denudation of eelgrass. \nTo denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m squared each) with a shovel in September 1975.\nI sampled plants and animals  using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm squared bottom area \u2013 approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting.\nMost of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot.\nFauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families.\nPlant material in each sample was separated into live Z. marina leaves, Z. marina root-rhizomes, macroalgae (by species) macrodetritus and Halodule wrightii (leaves plus root-rhizomes).  Macrodetritus was defined as brown or dark leaf material not connected to rhizomes, rhizomes without attached leaves with short (< 1 cm) or no roots and other dead plant material retained on a 0.8 mm mesh screen. All plant material was dried at 90 deg C to constant weight, weighed and ashed at 550 deg C for at least 2 hours. Ash free dry weight (AFDW) was determined by difference. \nWater temperature was measured in the field by a mercury thermometer.  Water samples were taken on site each month and measured for salinity using a hydrometer.\nDepths were measured on a grid for 156 points at each of the 4 sites and adjusted for changes during the sampling period and corrected to mean low tide by comparing contemporaneous readings on a tidal guide at Pivers Island, Beaufort, NC.\nResults:\nWater temperature ranged from  6 deg C in winter to summer highs of 31 detg C. Standing pools at low tide occasionally reached 37 deg C. Salinity ranged from 30.7 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Drum Shoals and from 31.5 ppt to 36.8 ppt at Middle Marsh.\nTwo hundred natural samples of epifauna and shallow benthos yielded over 93,00 individuals (approx. 5,000/square meter). Most were gastropods (43%), or amphipod crustaceans (41.5%) followed by polychaete annelids (5.2%), decapod crustaceans (3.5%), bivalve molluscs (3.4%) and isopod crustaceans (1.7%).  Zostera leaf biomass in natural samples varied greatly with location, season, and year and was usually higher at Middle Marsh (41 g AFDW / square m  versus 25 g AFDW / square m at Drum Shoals). \nInitial regrowth of seagrasses (99% Z. marina) after denudation occurred within six months at location M1, followed closely by D1 and D2. Within the first year after disturbance Z marina leaf biomass was similar to that of undisturbed subplots at D1, D2, and M1. Regrowth of M2, however, was almost absent the first year and leaf biomass was not equal to undisturbed subplots by June of the second year, normally the month with the highest plant biomass. Drift algae apparently settled in the slight depressions left after the denudation at M1 and M2. I occasionally observed algae in these denuded subplots while there were no algae on the bare sediment surrounding the depression. In the Middle Marsh (M1 and M2) denuded plots Sargassum contributed most (58%) of the seaweed biomass, followed by Agardhiella (23%), Codium (18%) and a small amount of Ulva (less than 1%).\nNumber of species and individuals was correlated with Zostera leaf biomass and macroalgae biomass but did not seem to have a simple linear relationship.", "attributeName": "Column 106", "entityDescription": "", "attributeDefinition": "# indiv", "entityName": "Zos_Epifauna_1975_1979_natural_plus_denuded.csv", "unit": "dimensionless"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "10", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00003359", "characteristic": "pato:elevation", "entity": "ecso:stream_channel_cross_section", "ent_no": "8", "pkg_id": "lusteve.53.12"}, "eml": {"abstract": "The rainfall amount and intensity of typhoon were rather different every year.

The scouring-deposition depths on streambeds of three reaches along Chungliao creek were between -19.0 cm and 94.3 cm from 2005 to 2007 years. The scores of channel stability indicators were between 81 and 123 and their ranks were from fair to good during three years from 2005 to 2007 year. The variations of scouring-deposition and channel stability indicators on three reaches for three years were affected by landslide areas along streamside as well as rainfall amount and intensity being carried by typhoon. The absolute values of scouring-deposition depths were positively responding with the variation of channel stability indicators. The absolute values of scouring-deposition depths increased as channel stability indicators increased and channel stability coditions become worse.

Regional circulation is characterized by generally cyclonic ocean currents in the Gulf of Alaska flowing onto the shelf off of Cook Inlet.  Nutrient rich bottom water is upwelled and mixed with surface water.  These enriched waters may enter into Kachemak Bay, the inflow tending to stay along the southern shore flowing past the Seldovia instruments, while water flowing out of the bay stays along the Inner Bay and north shore, flowing past the Homer instruments.  These trapped coastal flows separate the bay into two distinct ecosystems, and the instruments are positioned to reflect this distinction.  Within each system there is vertical stratification of the water.  The vertical placement of the sondes is designed to help elucidate the differences in circulation of the surface and deep waters. \n\t\nAs the inflowing water proceeds up the bay, fresh water runoff from the surrounding ice fields and watersheds dilute the salinity and increase the sediment load in the path of the Homer instruments.  The in-flowing water, in the path of the Seldovia instruments, initially supports a marine system, while the northern out-flowing water of the Homer instruments is more estuarine.  The Kachemak Bay water quality instruments capture this difference with deployments along the north and south shores.  These data will be used to supplement studies on primary productivity, larval distribution, settlement, recruitment, growth rates, community dynamics, and biodiversity in the bay.\n\nData can also be accessed through the National Estuarine Research Reserve System Centralized Data Management site: http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/get/export.cfm", "attributeName": "turb", "entityDescription": "Kachemak Bay water quality data, with qualifiers", "attributeDefinition": "Turbidity measured in nephtlometric turbidity units (NTU).

The relationship between F. sycomorus and fig wasps has been largely studied in ecology. More importantly, the relationship is an ideal model for co-evolutionary processes. It is thus essential to study what fig characteristics facilitate wasp populations inside figs. In this study, the influence of ripeness and size of the fig as well as location and human influence on the figs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 habitat were examined as possible determinants of wasp diversity in figs. After surveying 13 crops of F. sycomorus inflorescence, a total of 12 morphospecies were identified.  We found that ripeness, location, and human disturbance are the key characteristics for species diversity.  Fruit diameter did not show any relation with wasp diversity or abundance.

This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT.

A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. \n\nAbstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska. \n\nPublications:\nEdmundson, J.A., G.B.

The scouring-deposition depths on streambeds of three reaches along Chungliao creek were between -19.0 cm and 94.3 cm from 2005 to 2007 years. The scores of channel stability indicators were between 81 and 123 and their ranks were from fair to good during three years from 2005 to 2007 year. The variations of scouring-deposition and channel stability indicators on three reaches for three years were affected by landslide areas along streamside as well as rainfall amount and intensity being carried by typhoon. The absolute values of scouring-deposition depths were positively responding with the variation of channel stability indicators. The absolute values of scouring-deposition depths increased as channel stability indicators increased and channel stability coditions become worse. The major seven factors in channel stability indicators affecting the absolute values of scouring-depsotion depths were as follows: mass wasting, debris jam potential, cutting, deposition, scouring, obstruction, and particle packing.", "attributeName": "Elevation of no.4", "entityDescription": "Cross section no1-no12 of Chungliao middlestream reach in Nov 2007", "attributeDefinition": "an elevation (m) of cross section no.4 at any distance of cross section.", "entityName": "Cross section no1-no12 of Chungliao middlestream reach in Nov 2007 metadata2-4,a.csv", "unit": "meter"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "39", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002214", "characteristic": "pato:frequency", "entity": "taxa:Juncus_bufonius", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "Collinge.3.34"}, "eml": {"abstract": "We studied ecological dynamics of vernal pool plant\n        communities in California, USA, focusing on: 1) effects of\n        dispersal limitation, order of colonization, and frequency of\n        colonization on plant community composition; 2) invasion of\n        vernal pools by non-native species, and 3) comparison of\n        restored vernal pools to naturally-occurring pools.

The survey encompasses a major portion of the eastern Bering Sea shelf between the 20-m and the 200-m isobaths and from the Alaska Peninsula north to approximately the latitude of St. Matthew Island (60 degrees 50 minutes N).\n\nThese jellyfish data came from quantitative bottom trawl surveys of the EBS shelf conducted by the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) division of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), NOAA (data owner: Robert Lauth).  Since 1979, jellyfish have been collected annually during the period May 22 - Aug 19.  The survey of 356-376 stations arranged in a grid-like pattern takes approximately 2 months for 2 fishing vessels to complete.  A ~17-m wide, ~2.6 m high trawl is towed on the bottom for 30 min.  Because jellyfish are mostly distributed throughout the water column, their capture in the bottom trawl gear is likely occurring during the net retrieval operation.  We assume that these records, though not representative of the actual jellyfish abundance, can accurately represent the temporal and spatial variation throughout the study region. Although taxonomic data were not collected on the jellyfish caught, species composition data from recent years suggest that most of the biomass (>85%) consisted of one species, Chrysaora melanaster (Brodeur et al. 2002; Acuna, unpublished data).  Catches less than about 1150 kg were sorted and weighed completely. Larger catches were subsampled before processing.  Biomass density for each taxon was expressed as kg per ha of area swept by the trawl (distance fished x net width). \n\nCatches of all large jellyfish (medusae) are weighed and standardized to catch per unit effort (CPUE in kg per ha, where 1 ha = 10,000 square meters) (see Brodeur et al., 1999, for details).  Station-by-station CPUE data can be provided upon request.  The annual data provided for the JEDI database are in the form of a biomass index (units: 1000s of metric tons).  This biomass index was calculated for the survey area, adjusting for the area within each of six geographic areas (i.e., strata).  These jellyfish biomass estimates were made by expanding the mean density within each of six strata to the total area of the strata and summing over all areas.  Even though medusae are most likely to be captured during deployment or retrieval (as expressed above), the use of density is believed to be appropriate for this biomass index. \n\nMost references to density of pelagic zooplankton are expressed in weight per 1000 cubic meters of water filtered.  For purposes of comparison an average tow in this survey filters approximately 124,000 cubic meters.  However, the actual water filtered during deployment and retrieval is unknown and therefore the index concept is more appropriate for purposes of annual comparisons.\n\nTemperature profiles were taken at each station using an expendable bathy-thermograph (XBT) or a Sea-Bird micro-bathythermograph (MBT) attached to the headrope of the net.

However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as \u00cf\u00893:\u00cf\u00896.

Much of the wetland\n\t\t\t\trestoration effort in Wisconsin has occurred on formerly agricultural lands. However, due to\n\t\t\t\tthe nature of the past disturbance and possible residual effects not corrected by simply\n\t\t\t\treturning surface waters to these lands, there is some question regarding the resultant\n\t\t\t\twetland quality or biological integrity. In an effort aimed at developing tools to measure\n\t\t\t\twetland gains in terms of quality or ecological integrity, the Wisconsin Department of\n\t\t\t\tNatural Resources (WDNR) initiated a study of biological communities on restored wetlands in\n\t\t\t\tWisconsin. We report on the community of microcrustaceans and arthropods that can be\n\t\t\t\tcollected with a plankton net in open water in wetlands. We examined zooplankton community\n\t\t\t\tstructure in restored wetlands in terms of richness, taxonomic representation, and Daphnia\n\t\t\t\tsexual reproduction and related these metrics to attributes on wetlands representing\n\t\t\t\tleast-disturbed conditions and agriculturally impacted wetlands. We sampled 56 palustrine\n\t\t\t\twetlands distributed across Wisconsin. These wetland sites were categorized as agricultural,\n\t\t\t\tleast-impacted, and restored (recently withdrawn from agricultural usage). The wetlands were\n\t\t\t\treasonably homogeneous in many ways, so that taxon richness was not correlated with basin\n\t\t\t\torigin, presence of adjacent roads, presence or absence of fish, water chemistry, or the\n\t\t\t\tsize of the open water. We identified a total of 40 taxa.. We conclude that restoration of\n\t\t\t\twetland watersheds works. Withdrawal of the watershed from agricultural usage is followed by\n\t\t\t\tan increase in taxon richness, and the sites resembled least-impacted sites in about 6-7\n\t\t\t\tyears. Dodson, S.

The dataset here represents the monitoring at 700 m, 900 m and 1100 m asl on Mt Edith in the Lamb Range Uplands.", "attributeName": "species name", "entityDescription": "Biodiversity Monitoring 2013", "attributeDefinition": "Species Name", "entityName": "asn_fnqr_fauna_biodiversity_ctbcc_2013.csv", "unit": ""}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "10", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00003064", "characteristic": "pato:concentration_of", "entity": "ecso:alkalinity", "ent_no": "1", "pkg_id": "https://pasta.lternet.edu/package/metadata/eml/knb-lter-sbc/75/1"}, "eml": {"abstract": "\n      ", "attributeName": "TA_CO2calc_input", "entityDescription": "measured pH, alkalinity (or total CO2) from water samples with carbonate system parameters calculated by CO2calc for both laboratory (input) and in situ (adjusted) conditions", "attributeDefinition": "Total alkalinity (measured), micromol per kilogram seawater  (CO2calc input)", "entityName": "water sample pH and CO2calc output", "unit": "micromolePerKilogram"}}, {"anno": {"attr_no": "6", "class_uri": "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00003359", "characteristic": "pato:elevation", "entity": "ecso:stream_channel_cross_section", "ent_no": "7", "pkg_id": "lusteve.53.12"}, "eml": {"abstract": "The rainfall amount and intensity of typhoon were rather different every year. The moving gravel size and scouring energy of streambed by annual maximum stream flow were also varied. Therefore, the characteristics of streambed variation and channel stability were not easy understood. Measuring characteristics of cross section variations with levelling and evaluating conditions of channel stability with procedure original from Forest Service of United States for streambeds of three reaches along Chungliao creek were carried out in this study. The scouring-deposition depths on streambeds of three reaches along Chungliao creek were between -19.0 cm and 94.3 cm from 2005 to 2007 years. The scores of channel stability indicators were between 81 and 123 and their ranks were from fair to good during three years from 2005 to 2007 year. The variations of scouring-deposition and channel stability indicators on three reaches for three years were affected by landslide areas along streamside as well as rainfall amount and intensity being carried by typhoon. The absolute values of scouring-deposition depths were positively responding with the variation of channel stability indicators. The absolute values of scouring-deposition depths increased as channel stability indicators increased and channel stability coditions become worse. The major seven factors in channel stability indicators affecting the absolute values of scouring-depsotion depths were as follows: mass wasting, debris jam potential, cutting, deposition, scouring, obstruction, and particle packing.", "attributeName": "Elevation of no.3", "entityDescription": "Cross section no1-n012 of Chungliao middlestream reach in Dec 2006", "attributeDefinition": "an elevation (m) of cross section no.3 at any distance of cross section.", "entityName": "Cross section no1-no12 of Chungliao middlestream reach in Dec 2006 metadata2-3,a.csv", "unit": "meter"}}]
